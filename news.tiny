bea6e8a5-2f53-28a4-ef58-8d8c62a7b1c4.description	"<p>Today is Alan Turing&#8217;s 100th birthday. I&#8217;ve been thinking about him lately, in particular about a story that demonstrates the perils of working with genius.</p>\n<p>The story goes that, when Turing was working with the Manchester Baby (the first stored program computer ever built. Just) a colleague wrote the first ever assembler which would turn (relatively) human readable assembly language and turn it into the ones and zeroes of machine code that the machine could actually execute. He showed it to Turing, who blew up at him, ranting that using the computer to do &#8216;trivial&#8217; jobs like that were a massive waste of expensive computer time.</p>\n<p>The problem with working with a genius, from the point of view of more ordinary mortals, is that the genius has only a very rough idea of what is actually easy, and what is only easy to them. From today&#8217;s vantage point, when computers are as freely available as they are now, the idea of <em>not</em> letting the computer do the shitwork for you seems utterly ludicrous &#8211; programmer time is more valuable than computer time.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s less obvious is that the same was true in Turing&#8217;s time (when there was precisely one computer) too. It only takes one programmer to make a mistake in translating from assembler to machine code and run a job that, for instance, gets stuck in an infinite loop and you&#8217;ve probably wasted more computer time (and programmer time) than if you&#8217;d just run it through the assembler in the first place. Turing didn&#8217;t see that, because the process of translating from symbols to binary wasn&#8217;t something that he found particularly complicated. To him, what was needed wasn&#8217;t more and better tools, it was more and better Turings.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not entirely sure that I believe the story (and I can&#8217;t remember where I heard it, so it may be a phantom of my memory). It certainly doesn&#8217;t chime with the Turing who was instrumental in mechanising the shitwork of finding the days rotor settings so that Enigma traffic could be cracked. The history of Bletchley Park is a story of building better and better machines to do the dully repetitive jobs that humans find so hard to stick to and which machines excel at.</p>\n<p>The &#8220;Just write code without bugs in the first place&#8221; school of programming is alive and well today. It&#8217;s not my school though. I&#8217;m very much an exploratory coder. I like to have tests to show me the way and to keep me honest so that I don&#8217;t go breaking things when I change this bit here. I&#8217;ve customised my editing environment to help me as much as possible. I have a nasty habit of writing bare words that I should have quoted, so I have a keystroke that shoves the last word into quotes for me. Another keystroke will align all the broad arrows at the current level of nesting. I&#8217;ve got snippets set up that fill in standard boilerplate when I start a new class, a huge list of common spelling mistakes that get autocorrected while I&#8217;m not looking and an expanding list of other little helpers that I need to write when I get around to it. Automation lets me go faster, make more and better mistakes and recover from them faster. I am a of little brain and I want all the help I can give myself.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure that Turing would be in the same camp as me.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the thing though &#8211; Turing was, definitely, a genius. But his paper &#8220;On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem&#8221; (the one that gave the world the Turing Machine) has a bug in it. In fact, it has two. The first is obvious enough that I spotted it when i read the paper for the first time. The second bug is rather more subtle (but still fixable. It&#8217;s okay, the field of computing is not build on sand).</p>\n<p>I love that The Paper &#8211; The one that&#8217;s the theoretical basis for the modern world (first publishd 75 years ago, round(ish) number fans) &#8211; has a bug. It gives me a strange kind of hope. Fallibility gets us all &#8211; even people who have saved the world. I think we should celebrate the humanity as well as the genius. Turing was, by all accounts, a very odd fish, but the world is undeniably richer for his contributions.</p>\n<p>So, let&#8217;s raise a glass to the memory of Alan Turing tonight, marathon runner, gay icon, saviour of the world and the pleasantly fallible inventor of the modern world. Not a bad CV, when you think about it.</p>\n<h4>Updated</h4>\n<p>Apparently I&#8217;m wrong about it being Turing who didn&#8217;t like the assembler but Von Neumann (another genius). See below for details. And phew! How nice to find that a hero doesn&#8217;t have feet of clay.</p>"

It just so happened that <span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span> (Yet Another Perl Conference) was held in Asheville this year, the week before the gathering&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.swangathering.com/Catalog/TS/sgtssched.html\">Traditional Song Week</a>. Well, I&#8217;m a perl hacker. I sing traditional songs. My employer was paying for me to attend <span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span> and were willing for me to extend my stay in America by a week. It was a no brainer really.</p>\n<p><span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span> was bloody good this year. Perl 5 development is moving forward and the community is buzzing because of it. Lots of &#8220;… and we&#8217;re hiring&#8221; slides. And that&#8217;s before we get to the pleasure of catching up with friends that I only see online most of the time. If you&#8217;re working in any field that has grassroots conferences associated with it, I can&#8217;t recommend attending them highly enough.</p>\n<h3>On to Swannanoa</h3>\n<p>At Swannanoa, I met Sheila Kay Adams and immediately switched my schedule to spend as much time singing with her as possible. Sheila&#8217;s a seventh generation ballad singer from the Sodom Laurel community in Madison Count. Her &#8220;grannie Berzil&#8221; Wallin remembered Cecil Sharp coming to Madison County and collecting songs from the family.</p>\n<p>Pedigree in singing shouldn&#8217;t matter, but it turns out it does. Sheila grew up in a community which was changing, but which still had old &#8216;love songs&#8217; as an important part of how it understood the world. Today, not so much. People still relate to the world and understand it through songs, but the songs are more likely to be contemporary. Lyrically, many of the love songs that Sheila and her family sing could have been written yesterday, but their performance is radically different from contemporary style. One voice, unaccompanied, a style that requires the listener to concentrate on the song rather than any aspects of production. Not something you&#8217;re going to dance to at your wedding, say.</p>\n<p>Sheila&#8217;s classes, on Meeting House Songs (more later) and her Ballads class with Bobbie McMillon were just wonderful; I won&#8217;t forget in a hurry the sound Bobbie singing &#8220;A conversation with Death&#8221; as a thunderstorm grumbled across the campus in the background. Spine tingling stuff. Sheila&#8217;s description of how she learned songs &#8220;knee to knee&#8221; has been helpful too. The way it would work was that the teacher and student would be sat out on the porch, often doing some chore or another, and the teacher would sing the first verse of a song. The student would sing it back and the teacher would sing the second verse. The student would then sing the first two verses then the teacher would sing the third verse and the student would sing the first three verses and so on, until the student was singing the whole song back to the teacher. A time consuming process to be sure, but it works.</p>\n<p>I know this because I learned Pretty Saro from a recording of Sheila&#8217;s late husband Jim Taylor, using a variant of the method, &#8220;knee to CD&#8221; if you like. I&#8217;d play the first verse, hit pause and sing it back, play the second verse, pause, repeat the first two… and so on. And in very short order I had the words and tune (up to a point; I listened back to that recording again recently and I&#8217;m singing a different tune now) and could start the process of actually <em>learning</em> the song, which involved singing it it lots, listening to other recordings, singing it some more and then taking the song out and trying it out in front of audiences and listening to what works and what doesn&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve never really finished learning a song; this recording is a snapshot. I hope you enjoy it.</p>"

8086f78b-98d1-1477-04ba-a1e4df2bfb48.description	"<p>I sometimes think that I should have published the lyrics to <a href=\"http://www.bofh.org.uk/child-of-the-library\">Child of the Library</a> with a bibliography. The references in the second verse are all obvious to me, but I&#8217;m a white middle class English boy who grew up around boats. My childhood reading and yours may not intersect all that much.</p>\n<p>So&#8230;</p>\n<h4>The Walkers and the Blacketts</h4>\n<p>Also known as the <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=intitle:%22Swallows+and+Amazons%22\">Swallows and Amazons.</a> <cite>Swallows and Amazons</cite> is the first &#8216;big&#8217; book that I can remember reading for myself. We were in Cornwall, holidaying at the same place my mum&#8217;s been going to since she was a kid. Mum was reading <cite>Swallows and Amazons</cite> to us, and it was great, but I was impatient to find out what happened next, so I took the book to bed with me and read it for myself. I haven&#8217;t stopped yet. <cite>Swallows and Amazons</cite> was the book that opened my door to reading for pleasure. It opened up a way of looking at the world too. I can&#8217;t imagine who I&#8217;d be if I&#8217;d never read any Ransome.</p>\n<h4>The Pevensies</h4>\n<p>The Pevensies are the family in <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=intitle:%22The+Lion+The+Witch+And+The+Wardrobe%22\">The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe,</a> the first of the Narnia books. I have a slightly troubled relationship with these books now. I <em>really</em> don&#8217;t get on with C. S. Lewis&#8217;s view of the world (I once hurled a taped reading of <cite>The Screwtape Letters</cite> out of the car rather than listen to another word of the bloody things), but I wasn&#8217;t reading between the lines when I was nine. I was just loving the stories and the images they put in my head. And what images&#8230;</p>\n<h4>Simp, the Canine Cannonball</h4>\n<p>What do you mean, you&#8217;ve never read <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=intitle:%22Cannonball+Simp%22\">Cannonball Simp?</a> You poor thing!</p>\n<p><cite>Cannonball Simp</cite>, by John Burningham is <em>the</em> library book for me. Back when I was 4 or 5, I would walk with my dad from Regent&#8217;s Square to the Doncaster Central Library every Saturday morning, with three books clutched under my arm. I&#8217;d hand them over the counter, receiving in exchange 3 buff cardboard library slip holders. I would then go over to the childrens&#8217; books section and pull out three new (to me) books and take them to the counter. The librarian would remove the slip from the library bookplate, place it in one of my surrendered holders and stamp the slip and the bookplate with the date, three weeks hence, by which the book must be renewed.</p>\n<p>Well, that&#8217;s how it worked until weekend I came back with <cite>Cannonball Simp</cite>. I <em>loved</em> it. I didn&#8217;t want to take it back because I hadn&#8217;t learned it yet. Sure I could &#8216;read&#8217; along with Dad &#8211; I knew all the words by then &#8211; but the pictures were another thing entirely. They were <em>beautiful</em>. They still are.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s when I learned of the magic of &#8216;renewal&#8217;. Instead of handing the book back, I showed it to the librarian and said &#8220;I&#8217;d like to renew this, please,&#8221; and instead of giving me my library card back, they just stamped the book and slip with a new date. Wow! It was like I <em>owned</em> the book.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know how many times I renewed that book. I&#8217;m afraid I don&#8217;t remember the words any more. But I still remember the pleasure that it gave me.</p>\n<h4>Galadriel the Fair</h4>\n<p>On the last day of junior school our form teacher, Miss Rees, wrote a long list of books on the board and asked us to copy the list into the back of our exercise books. She said that these were books we should try and read. I don&#8217;t have the exercise book any more and I remember very little of the list. I do remember that I&#8217;d already read some of them. And I remember <cite>The Hobbit</cite> and <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=intitle:%22The+Lord+of+the+Rings%22\">The Lord of the Rings</a>. Oh boy, do I remember <cite>The Hobbit</cite> and <cite>The Lord of the Rings</cite>.</p>\n<p>Terry Pratchett said that if you&#8217;re a 14 year old boy and you don&#8217;t think that The Lord of the Rings is the best book ever written then there may be something wrong with you, but if you&#8217;re 28 and you <em>still</em> think it&#8217;s the best book ever written then there&#8217;s <em>definitely</em> something wrong with you. I <em>was</em> that 14 year old boy. I stayed up all night reading it. I fell asleep reading it. I read the appendices. I worked out how to write my name in Elvish script. I even read <cite>The Silmarillion</cite> and thought I enjoyed it. I can still recite some of the poetry. In Elvish. I&#8217;ve forgotten the words of Cannonball Simp, but get me going with &#8220;A Elbereth Gilthoniel&#8230;&#8221; and I can just about reel off the rest of the poem. What&#8217;s wrong with me?</p>\n<p>By the time I was 28, LotR wasn&#8217;t the best book ever written. I&#8217;m no longer sure that there is such a thing as &#8220;The Best Book Ever Written&#8221;. Still, if you haven&#8217;t at least read <cite>The Hobbit</cite> you should take steps to rectify matters. Or wait for the Peter Jackson movie.</p>\n<h4>The Daughter of a Pirate King</h4>\n<p>Confession time: I haven&#8217;t read <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=intitle:%22Pippi+Longstocking%22\">Pippi Longstocking</a>. The &#8216;I&#8217; of <cite>A Child of the Library</cite> is a composite of Gill and me. <cite>Pippi Longstocking</cite> was her Nancy Blackett. The  <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=Bastable+inauthor:Nesbit\">Bastables</a> were her Pevensies.</p>\n<h4>Paddington the Bear</h4>\n<p>Once I&#8217;d learned that reading for myself was pure pleasure, I read anything and everything I could find in the library and I discovered Michael Bond&#8217;s <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=intitle:Paddington+inauthor:%22Michael+Bond%22\">Paddington Bear</a>. Paddington was a well meaning young bear from Peru who was found, wearing a duffel coat and a label reading &#8220;Please look after this bear&#8221;, at Paddington Station by the Brown Family. The Browns took him in immediately, named him Paddington after the station and&#8230; &#8216;hijinks ensue&#8217;.</p>\n<p>I would be quietly reading these books to myself when some episode or another (&#8220;Baked Elastic&#8221;; the Russian ballet dancer; the wobbly table&#8230;) would cause me to laugh out loud and my brother would demand to know what was funny and made me read whatever it was aloud to him. I have to confess, I resented this, but not enough to dent my enjoyment. The Paddington books are made of joy.</p>"

0bebb5e6-4b50-7682-e246-8793d7213a2b.description	"<p>Or… what I did this summer.</p>\n<p>Summer as been frantic. Mostly joyous, but frantic.</p>\n<p>I had talks accepted at both <a href=\"http://www.yapc2011.us/yn2011/\"><span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span></a> and <a href=\"http://oscon.com/\"><span class=\"caps\">OSCON</span></a>. Because <span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span> was in Asheville, and the <a href=\"http://www.swangathering.com/\">Swannanoa Gathering</a> Traditional Song Week fell the week after <span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span>, that meant I flew out to Asheville for an intense fortnight of Perl community engagement followed by a week spent singing myself hoarse and being blown away by <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/sheilakayadams\">Sheila Kay Adams&#8217;s</a> singing and her stories of mountain life and listening to future stars like <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/sheilakayadams\">Sam Gleaves</a> and inspiring activists like <a href=\"http://www.blairpathways.com/\">Saro Lynch Thomason</a>. I could write entire posts on every one of those, and that&#8217;s before I get on to the magic of watching the sun go down and the fireflies come up from the grass of the Warren Wilson College&#8217;s natural amphitheatre. Magical so it was.</p>\n<p>On the last night of the gathering, there was a student showcase. Of course, I sang <a href=\"http://www.bofh.org.uk/child-of-the-library\">Child of the Library</a>. Rather embarrassingly, I skipped a verse, but the response was great. Several people came up to me afterwards and told me their library stories and, I hope, went home with a determination to help protect their libraries.</p>\n<p>Then it was back to the UK for a fortnight before heading off again to <span class=\"caps\">OSCON</span> in Portland, OR. I was down to give two talks, one on <a href=\"http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011/public/schedule/detail/17872\">Higher Order Javascript</a> and a second on <a href=\"http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011/public/schedule/detail/18577\">Polymorphic Dispatch</a> which proved to be a bear to write. I&#8217;d planned to have everything done and dusted and the slides learned by the time I flew out, but spent a huge amount of time blocked on how I was going to present the ideas using a motivating problem that hit the sweet spot between too simple and too complicated. It wasn&#8217;t until I arrived in Portland and talked things through with my host, <a href=\"http://www.justatheory.com/\">David Wheeler</a>, that I got that worked out. The slides were written in a tearing rush and weren&#8217;t as good as I would like them to be. I still owe the talk attendees a full writeup, so I&#8217;ll take this opportunity to apologise for the lateness and promise that a writeup <em>will</em> arrive. The Javascript talk was based on one I&#8217;ve given before, but I&#8217;m starting to realise that it&#8217;s a full tutorial masquerading as a short talk. More on that later, I hope.</p>\n<p>What with flapping about the unwritten talk, and the 10 minute gap between them, I didn&#8217;t really worry overmuch about the Perl lightning talks. It&#8217;s been my practice to sing a lightly massaged version of <a href=\"http://LOUANDPETER.COM/\">Lou and Peter Berryman&#8217;s</a> very splendid song <cite>A Chat With Your Mother</cite> with tailored verses about different language communities and various Perl luminaries. I <em>had</em> decided to retire it, but at <span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span> I came up with a snide verse about myself and another about Larry Wall, so it felt renewed enough to be worth singing this year as well. I ended up singing Child of the Library again.</p>\n<p>The response was phenomenal. I&#8217;ve been singing it for long enough now that I know it <em>gets</em> people. Hell, when I was writing it, there were verses that were hard to sing because they got me and I was choking up as I tried to sing them. But the lightning talk got a standing ovation. Again people were telling me library stories and I found that the UK isn&#8217;t the only country with local governments stupid enough to consider closing libraries, it was happening in the US too. So, fired up by that response, I went to see Sarah Novotny and begged her for five minutes on the <span class=\"caps\">OSCON</span> stage before the closing keynote. Bless her, she let me have it.</p>\n<h3>Pics, or it didn&#8217;t happen!</h3>\n<p>I have proof too! The main stage at O&#8217;Reilly events has serious video equipment pointed at it. Because it&#8217;s important that people get to see serious talks about <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnX5v0uwNjc&amp;list=PL93FC98105B19725C&amp;index=39&amp;feature=plpp\">known bugs and exploits in wetware</a>. Because my performance wasn&#8217;t on the schedule, and I didn&#8217;t have a video release all signed and ready to go beforehand, it&#8217;s taken a while to get the video available. But last night, that changed, so here I am, in all my corpulent glory. Enjoy. And please, spread this video as far and as wide as you can. Libraries are important.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"345\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/MDi5JtS1H-g\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>"

This happens as I sing  it out to different audiences and find out which bits work, which bits are hard to sing and all the other little details that you only find out when there&#8217;s a living, breathing, listening and (hopefully) singing audience in front of you.</p>\n<p>It turns out that the same things happens with songs I&#8217;ve written.</p>\n<p>The biggest stumbling block of the original version is the last line of the first verse:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My wife met Pippi Langstumpf, I met Paddington the Bear</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Someone on the comment thread suggested:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Heidi, Pippi Longstocking and Paddington the Bear</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which is fine, except that means singing &#8216;PIPpi LONGstockING&#8217;, and I&#8217;m not happy with putting the emphasis on the <span class=\"caps\">WRONG</span> sylLABles if I can possibly help it. In the revised version, I think I&#8217;ve cracked it. The line is now:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The daughter of a pirate king and Paddington the bear</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which is <em>much</em> easier to sing and follows the rest of the verse by being a more oblique reference to the character. If you know who Pippi is, then it&#8217;s obvious who I&#8217;m singing about. If you don&#8217;t, then maybe I&#8217;ve piqued your curiosity.</p>\n<p>The first recording also had two slightly different tunes for the verses, this version has settled on just the one.</p>\n<p>And, for people who care about that sort of thing, this was recorded with a click track at 110bpm rather than speeding up over the course of the song, which should make life a little easier for anyone taking part in Rabid Gravy&#8217;s <a href=\"http://blog.rabidgravy.com/making-music-to-save-our-libraries\">project</a> to remix and rerecord different versions of the song.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re concerned about Library closures, a good place to start is <a href=\"http://www.voicesforthelibrary.org.uk/\">Voices for the Library</a>. If you&#8217;re on twitter, you might also start following <a href=\"http://twitter.com/ukpling\">@ukpling</a>. If you&#8217;re not concerned about library closures, why on earth did you read this far, and what kind of excuse for a human being are you?</p>"

Frankly, instrumentation scares me, I&#8217;m much happier singing unaccompanied but I realise I&#8217;m in a minority on this.</p>\n<p>When you sing it, try making the song your own by changing things to suit your own. Julie Chilton&#8217;s posted an alternate first verse in the comments, but the world is the mollusc of your choice.</p>\n<p>The &#8216;I&#8217; in the song, isn&#8217;t <em>quite</em> me and it isn&#8217;t quite Gill either. Most importantly, both of us grew up in houses where no book was out of bounds. Our fathers used to take us to our respective local libraries (Lewisham for Gill, Doncaster Central and then Bawtry for me) every week or so on a Saturday morning. As soon as I was old enough, I&#8217;d ride my bike from our home in Scrooby to Bawtry with a carrier full of books hanging off the handlebars. Bawtry is currently in the crosshairs of Doncaster&#8217;s idiot mayor &#8211; the bloke who suggested getting kindles for everyone instead &#8211; along with 13 other libraries in the district.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a revised version of the recording with additional notes at: http://www.bofh.org.uk/2011/04/04/a-child-of-the-library-revised, or just press play:</p>\n<p><object height=\"81\" width=\"100%\"> <param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F13031396\"></param> <param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param> <embed allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"81\" src=\"http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F13031396\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed> </object>  <span><a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/pdcawley/child-of-the-library-revised\">Child Of The Library (Revised)</a> by <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/pdcawley\">pdcawley</a></span></p>\n<h5>August 9th 2011</h5>\n<p>I&#8217;ve updated the lyrics here to reflect what I sing now.

You don&#8217;t need autotune, you don&#8217;t need a record label, you don&#8217;t need drums, a guitar or anything else but your hands, feet, ears, brain and mouth to make music that will satisfy you for the rest of your life.</p>\n<p>By the end of this talk I promise that, unless you are one of a tiny, tiny minority of people, you&#8217;ll not be tone deaf, you&#8217;ll be damn near pitch perfect. And you&#8217;ll have a song in your head that, unless I have seriously misjudged the people who come to <span class=\"caps\">OSCON</span>, you&#8217;ll want to teach to everyone you know.</p>\n<p>Come along. Clap your hands. Stamp your feet and sing. What have you got to lose?</p>"

a9a7f5e3-6b9f-e4d0-203a-b5a37ee9bff6.description	"<p>I haven't written an infinite loop bug in a while. I suppose I was due. (The Greek gods always punish hubris.)</p>\n\n<p>I have a database table full of users. Let's call that table\n<code>user</code>. A user has one or more roles (from the <code>role</code>)\ntable. A user can be an unverified user, a free user, a subscriber, or an\nadministrator. (Administrators obviously are also subscribers, but you get the\npoint.)</p>\n\n<p>I use <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?DBIx::Class\">DBIx::Class</a>\nfor the database access layer. My <code>User</code> result class has a couple\nof methods which let other model actions query whether the user can perform\nspecific operations. They're <a\nhref=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2011/05/decoupling-testability-and-synthetic-attributes.html\">synthetic\nattributes</a>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>has [<span class=\"Constant\">qw(</span><span class=\"Constant\"> is_admin is_subscriber </span><span class=\"Constant\">)</span>], <span class=\"Constant\">is</span> =&gt; <span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">ro</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span>, <span class=\"Constant\">lazy_build</span> =&gt; <span class=\"Constant\">1</span>;\n\n<span class=\"Statement\">sub </span><span class=\"Identifier\">_build_is_admin      </span>{ <span class=\"Statement\">shift</span>-&gt;find_role_by_name( <span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">admin</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span>      ) }\n<span class=\"Statement\">sub </span><span class=\"Identifier\">_build_is_subscriber </span>{ <span class=\"Statement\">shift</span>-&gt;find_role_by_name( <span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">subscriber</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span> ) }</code></pre>\n\n<p>Obviously the implementation of <code>find_role_by_name()</code> is\nsupremely important. Here's how I originally wrote the code (no sense blaming\nanyone else for this, because <em>I</em> wrote all of the access control code\nmyself.) See if you can catch the bug:</p>\n\n<pre><code><span class=\"Statement\">sub </span><span class=\"Identifier\">find_role_by_name</span>\n{\n    <span class=\"Statement\">my</span> (<span class=\"Identifier\">$self</span>, <span class=\"Identifier\">$name</span>) = <span class=\"Identifier\">@_</span>;\n\n    <span class=\"Statement\">while</span> (<span class=\"Statement\">my</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$role</span> = <span class=\"Identifier\">$self</span><span class=\"Identifier\">-&gt;user_roles-&gt;next</span>)\n    {\n        <span class=\"Statement\">return</span> <span class=\"Constant\">1</span> <span class=\"Statement\">if</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$role</span><span class=\"Identifier\">-&gt;role-&gt;name</span> <span class=\"Statement\">eq</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$name</span>;\n    }\n\n    <span class=\"Statement\">return</span> <span class=\"Constant\">0</span>;\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>As a hint, the <code>user_roles</code> method represents the relationship\nbetween the <code>user</code> table and the <code>role</code> table. That\nmethod returns a DBIC resultset which represents the entries in the table with\na foreign key to the <code>user</code> table.</p>\n\n<p>See the bug yet? It took me a while. The problem is that <em>every\ninvocation of the loop</em> fetches a new resultset. Every invocation of the\nloop fetches only the <em>first</em> result from that resultset.</p>\n\n<p>My tests (yeah, I wrote the tests too, before I wrote this code in fact,\njust like you're supposed to do) didn't catch that because the rest of the code\nonly ever checked for one user role, the administrator role, anywhere else.\nOnly when I added code for the subscriber role did the subscription tests\ntrigger this infinite loop. (Now how abhorred in my imagination is that most\nexcellent jest!)</p>\n\n<p>I wish I could say that I diagnosed the cause immediately. I didn't. I\nstared at the code for far too long, until I had the presence of mind to put a\ndebugging statement in the loop body to print the name of the role.  (Stat\nofficium pristina nomine.)</p>\n\n<p>Here's the corrected code, with a single expression hoisted into a scalar\nvariable where it may endure properly:</p>\n\n<pre><code><span class=\"Statement\">sub </span><span class=\"Identifier\">find_role_by_name</span>\n{\n    <span class=\"Statement\">my</span> (<span class=\"Identifier\">$self</span>, <span class=\"Identifier\">$name</span>) = <span class=\"Identifier\">@_</span>;\n    <span class=\"Statement\">my</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$user_roles_rs</span> = <span class=\"Identifier\">$self</span><span class=\"Identifier\">-&gt;user_roles</span>;\n\n    <span class=\"Statement\">while</span> (<span class=\"Statement\">my</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$role</span> = <span class=\"Identifier\">$user_roles_rs</span><span class=\"Identifier\">-&gt;next</span>)\n    {\n        <span class=\"Statement\">return</span> <span class=\"Constant\">1</span> <span class=\"Statement\">if</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$role</span><span class=\"Identifier\">-&gt;role-&gt;name</span> <span class=\"Statement\">eq</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$name</span>;\n    }\n\n    <span class=\"Statement\">return</span> <span class=\"Constant\">0</span>;\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>I will say this: expecting your test suite to pass in under 30 seconds makes this sort of thing much easier to catch. If I'd had to wait for a continuous integration server to get around to checking this commit, I wouldn't have fixed it as quickly as I did.</p>\n\n<p>Then again, it's easier to debug bugs you never write in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>Oh, and if you catch the literary allusion in the title, here's your prize:\ncongratulations! You might be overeducated. (If you caught the other three\nallusions, have you ever noticed how much Pynchon's <em>V</em> influenced\nStephenson's <em>Cryptonomicon</em>?)</p>"

Consider\ntypical Moose code:</p>\n\n<pre><code><span class=\"Statement\">package</span><span class=\"Type\"> MyApp::App::Role::HasMailer</span>;\n<span class=\"Comment\"># ABSTRACT: role which provides other app roles with a mailer</span>\n\n<span class=\"Statement\">use </span>Modern::Perl;\n<span class=\"Statement\">use </span>Moose::Role;\n\n<span class=\"Statement\">use </span>MyApp::Mailer;\n\nhas <span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">mailer</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span>, <span class=\"Constant\">is</span> =&gt; <span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">ro</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span>, <span class=\"Constant\">lazy_build</span> =&gt; <span class=\"Constant\">1</span>;\n\n<span class=\"Statement\">sub </span><span class=\"Identifier\">_build_mailer</span>\n{\n    <span class=\"Statement\">my</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$self</span>        = <span class=\"Statement\">shift</span>;\n    <span class=\"Statement\">my</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$config</span>      = <span class=\"Statement\">do</span> <span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">myapp_local.pl</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span>;\n    <span class=\"Statement\">my</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$mail_client</span> = <span class=\"Identifier\">$config-&gt;{</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">Model::UserMail</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Identifier\">}</span><span class=\"Identifier\">{</span><span class=\"Constant\">mail_client</span><span class=\"Identifier\">}</span>;\n    <span class=\"Statement\">return</span> MyApp::Mailer-&gt;new( <span class=\"Identifier\">$mail_client</span> );\n}\n\n<span class=\"Constant\">1</span>;</code></pre>\n\n<p>... where functions such as <code>has</code> and <code>with</code> and\n<code>extends</code> look like declarations (such as <code>my</code> and\n<code>sub</code>), but are actually code to run.</p>\n\n<p>The difference is important. A declaration that's part of the language's\ngrammar need only be <em>parsed</em> to have its effects take place, while a\nstatement or expression needs to <em>run</em> to take place.</p>\n\n<p>This is, of course, why variable declarations makes lexical scoping trivial\nto understand for experienced Perl programmers, why binding closures to their\nlexical environments is easy in the simple cases, and why binding closures to\ntheir lexical environments when you use the STRING form of <code>eval</code> is\nso difficult.</p>\n\n<p>As Moose hackers will tell you, Moose isn't a simple preprocessor you run\nover your code once to generate <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Moose::Manual::Unsweetened\">longer, uglier\ncode without syntactic goodness</a>. Instead, <a\nhref=\"http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=685459\">classes are built, not\ndeclared</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This is endemic to Moose, but it's not a characteristic specific to Modern\nPerl. It's inherent in Perl 5 itself, even the 1994 version. <a\nhref=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2009/08/how-a-perl-5-program-works.html\">Perl\n5 lets you run arbitrary code while parsing happens</a>.</p>\n\n<p>While you can gain tremendous flexibility with this approach (building up\nclosures with partially applied arguments to export to caller namespaces), you\ncan't serialize the resulting code as easily because you may have to run\narbitrary code to restore your program in memory.</p>\n\n<p>Put another way, <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Exporter\">Exporter</a> is a library while\nit should be core language behavior.</p>\n\n<p>In the simple case where a library wants to export a couple of symbols into\nthe caller's namespace, say <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> from <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?List::Util\">List::Util</a>, why is there\nno simple syntax for marking those symbols as exportable in\n<code>List::Util</code> without having to run code (or worse yet, <em>inherit\nfrom</em>) <code>Exporter</code>?</p>\n\n<p>If a declarative syntax existed&mdash;with language support or at least the\nbroad consistency to allow for tool support&mdash;such that it were statically\npossible to determine the symbols exported from one package and imported into\nanother package, precompilation would be easier. A module could have a static\nlist of exports provided in a manifest of sorts. (A good optimizer could even\ndecline to import unused code!)</p>\n\n<p>I realize it isn't always possible to reduce all cases of exporting to a\nlist of static symbols (nor is it desirable to remove that power), but at least\n80% of the code I write would benefit from this. We'd also be able to have\nbetter tool support for the language; it would be easier to discover which\nsymbols come from where, and we might even close the \"You can't always tell\nwhich of two interpretations of a parse tree is valid in Perl 5 code thanks to\n<code>import</code> and <code>BEGIN</code>\" gap a little further.</p>\n\n<p>(... but then someone will ask why <code>strict</code> is a pragma and not\ncore language behavior, especially after looking at its implementation, and\nthen we'll all go to the paint store to pick out our favorite colors. See also \"I didn't provide an example of this declarative syntax, so you can't argue about it in the comments.\")</p>"

df8807b5-f1d9-5015-b17c-642f2c02b617.description	"<p>One of my work projects has a test suite that's grown a little too slow for\nmy liking. With only a few hundred tests, I've seen our test runs take over 30\nseconds in a couple of cases. We're diligent about separating tests into\nindividual logical files, so that when we work on a feature we can run only its\ntests as we develop and save running the whole suite for the last verification\nbefore checkin, but 30 seconds is still too long.</p>\n\n<p>(Before you ask, <a\nhref=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2011/11/parallelism-and-test-suites.html\">our\ntest suite is fully parallelizable</a>, so that 30 seconds keeps all of the\ncores on a development box at full usage.)</p>\n\n<p>I realize that one fad in software of the last few years is continuous\nintegration, where you submit your commits to a box somewhere for that to run\nthe full test suite and email you if something goes wrong, sometime in the\nfuture, hopefully less than an hour from now. Hopefully.</p>\n\n<p>We can't afford to wait that long to know if our code is right. (I like to\npush to our production box as soon as we have well-tested fixes that we know\nwork reliably. That's often more than once per day. I'm the only one working on\nthe site today, and I've already pushed three changes, with at least one more\ncoming.)</p>\n\n<p>When I worked on <a href=\"http://parrotcode.org/\">Parrot</a>, I spent a lot\nof time profiling the VM to sneak out small performance improvements here and\nthere, using less memory and far fewer CPU cycles. I'm at home in a profiler,\nso I picked a very small test program and ran it through <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Devel::NYTProf\">Devel::NYTProf</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I've mentioned before that this application has a <a\nhref=\"http://catalystframework.org/\">Catalyst</a> frontend which takes full\nadvantage of <a href=\"http://moose.perl.org/\">Moose</a> throughout. It uses <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?DBIx::Class\">DBIx::Class</a> as its\npersistence layer.</p>\n\n<p>As you might expect, <em>startup</em> time dominates most of the tests. We\nhave 21 individual test files, and startup took close to two seconds for each\nof them. No matter how much we parallelized, we were always going to spend no\nless than 40 total seconds running tests. (The non-parallel test suite runs in\n~67 seconds, so parallelization already gives a 55% improvement.)</p>\n\n<p>When I looked at the profile, I saw that most of the startup time came from\na couple of dependencies we didn't need.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, even though I use <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?HTML::FormHandler\">HTML::FormHandler</a>\nquite happily on another project, we don't use it on this project at all. We\ndid use a Catalyst plugin which brought it in as a dependency, but we never\nused that feature.</p>\n\n<p>I spent an hour revising that part of our application to remove that plugin\n(which we used to use, then customized our code so that the plugin was almost\nvestigial) and the parallel test run went down to 23 seconds.</p>\n\n<p>We trimmed 10% of our dependencies, just by removing one plugin and the code\nit brought in.</p>\n\n<p>(Tip: use <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Devel::TraceUse\">Devel::TraceUse</a> to\nfind out which modules load which modules. It's a good way to get the\nconceptual weight of a dependency.)</p>\n\n<p>I don't shy away from dependencies when they're useful, but I ended up\nrevising one file and ending up with <em>less</em> code overall than we had\nbefore I started.</p>\n\n<p>With that said, there's clearly room for improvement. I traced through some\nMoose code which handles initialization (especially of attributes) and it seems\nlike there should be some efficiency gains there. Similarly, both Catalyst and\nDBIC go through some contortions to load plugins and components that in my case\nwere unnecessary. (I have a patch to consider for the former, but not the\nlatter.)</p>\n\n<p>Two things I learned do bother me somewhat. If you use\n<code>Devel::TraceUse</code> on a project of any size, you'll see a lot of\ninconsistency and duplication, thanks to years of TIMTOWTDI. Catalyst brings in\nMoose, but DBIC eventually ends up bringing in <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Moo\">Moo</a>. No one can decide whether to\nuse <code>@ISA</code> or <code>use base '...';</code> or <code>use parent\n'...';</code>. A lot of larger projects (DateTime, Moose extensions) have lots\nof helper modules spread out in lots of tiny <em>.pm</em> files which each need\nto be located, loaded, and compiled.</p>\n\n<p>Worse, all of the nice declarative syntax you get with some of these modern\nlibraries has a cost behind the scenes every time you run the program <em>even\nif nothing has changed</em>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=990666\">If I were to pick an\noptimization target for future versions of Perl 5</a>, I'd want a good way for\nMoose or Catalyst or whatever to precompile my nice sugared code into a cached\nrepresentation that could then load faster on subsequent invocations. (I know\nyou're not getting an order of magnitude improvement here: you still have to\nset up stubs for metaclasses and the like, but even getting attributes and\nmethods in place would be an improvement!)</p>\n\n<p>I'd settle today for a preforking test suite that doesn't require me to\nrewrite all of my tests.</p>\n\n<p>Then again, that ~25% improvement in test execution from removing one\ndependency isn't bad for the week either.</p>"

You know the one.</p>\n\n<blockquote><em>You shouldn't feel offended. That's just silly.</em></blockquote>\n\n<h2>Yet Another Bad Example</h2>\n\n<p>Take, for example, <a href=\"http://stripgenerator.com/strip/597425/moose-moore-or-mouse/\">a cartoon comparing the Moose object system to elective breast enhancement surgery and the attractiveness of an actress before and after such surgery</a>. (Hmm, it's even <em>less</em> amusing when I describe it that way.)</p>\n\n<p>As you might rightly imagine, several people winced at <a\nhref=\"http://blogs.perl.org/users/joe_mcmahon1/2012/08/why-im-considering-dropping-perlmonks.html\">yet\nanother incident of the sexualization of something that's not sexual at\nall</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As you might sadly expect, the responses to that incident were <a\nhref=\"http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=989177\">attempts to wave away any\ndisagreement by dismissing the possibility anyone might feel any justified\noffense or exclusion or discomfort</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you're playing <a href=\"http://www.derailingfordummies.com/\">derailment</a> bingo, grab an extra card.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't difficult, my friends. It's actually very simple.</p>\n\n<h2>The Unnecessary Sexualization of Technology</h2>\n\n<p>People have sex. Yes, everyone understands that. Most of us in the world of\ntechnology are adults, or at least have gone through puberty. Everyone\nunderstands that too.</p>\n\n<p>Yet when I as a heterosexual adult male go to a conference or a user group\nmeeting or participate in a mailing list or a web forum or an IRC channel\n<em>devoted to technology</em>, I have no desire to talk about sex. Even though\nat least 90% of the other participants are likely straight adult males like me,\nthe purpose of the group has nothing to do with sex or sexuality.</p>\n\n<p>Now imagine that you're not in that 90% group and you want to talk about\ntechnology, but you have to wade through discussions of things that are\ncompletely unrelated, sensitive, and which continually point out to you that\nyou are very different from that group. Constantly.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine going to an event where your nametag says \"I don't belong\" and every\nconversation you try to have starts with the other person saying \"Hi! You don't\nbelong here! How are you today?\"</p>\n\n<p>(I went to a charity auction earlier this year where the bids started at\nmultiple thousands of dollars for packages like a week's vacation on a private\nisland and a chartered flight to one of the world's top golf spots. They had a\nwine wall where some bottles cost more than my suit. I left before dessert. I\ndidn't belong.)</p>\n\n<p>If you try to justify the sexualization of technology with \"It's just a\njoke\" or \"It's a beautiful, normal part of human existence\" or \"Lighten up\",\nyou're behaving rudely. Please stop.</p>\n\n<p>If you're thinking of complaining \"But this means we can't talk about other\nthings we like, like Dr. Who or comic books! Why are you censoring us? How\nboring it would be to talk about technology alone all the time!\" then you're\ncommitting the slippery slope fallacy and demonstrating a false equivalence\nfallacy. Please instead discuss things like a rational adult with listening and\nreasoning skills.</p>\n\n<h2>Only I Get to Define \"Offensiveness\"</h2>\n\n<p>If telling other people they don't belong isn't bad enough, my favorite\nexhibit of bad behavior is telling people their feelings don't matter because\nonly you get to decide what they can find offensive or exclusionary or mean-spirited or inappropriate.</p>\n\n<p>This happens in many ways. (This list is <em>not</em> exhaustive.)</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\"But I asked a (insert token member of the group you supposedly \"offended\" here) and they said it was okay.</li>\n\n<li>\"It's just a joke, lighten up.\"</li>\n\n<li>\"You're misunderstanding the joke.\"</li>\n\n<li>\"You don't have a sense of humor.\"</li>\n\n<li>\"There's no logical reason for you to feel offended.\"</li>\n\n<li>\"You're making too big a deal out of this.\"</li>\n\n<li>\"You're making (insert the group you supposedly \"offended\" here) out to be humorless prigs, all too ready to jump on honest, good-hearted, handsome people like me, and you're shrill and probably no fun to hang out with in person too.\"</li>\n\n<li>\"I'm not as bad as (Hitler). Get some perspective.\"</li>\n\n<li>\"(Insert some other bad thing here which you perceive to be a bigger problem) is a bigger problem in the world. Why don't you solve that first?\"</li>\n\n<li>\"Everyone I know in person says I'm not (insert some epithet), therefore I\ncan never exhibit this bad behavior you ascribe to me. Thus it never happened.\nQED.\"</li>\n\n<li>\"Everyone's offended by something, so if we always sought to avoid offense, we'd never do anything. Therefore doing anything is going to offend, so you really need to get over it.\"</li>\n\n<li>\"Everyone else is stupid except me. Everyone else is an unenlightened boor except me. Bow down before your cultural and moral superior.\"</li>\n\n<li>\"If you interpreted it that way, it's <em>your</em> mind with the problem. Takes one to know one.\"</li>\n\n<li>\"You're the only one complaining. Silence implies consent. Therefore it's\nnot really a big deal!\"</li>\n\n<li>\"(Insert some group underrepresented in the community) don't like (the focus of the community) anyway. So what's the problem?\"</li>\n\n<li>\"You're acting like a patronizing nanny, and we reasonable adults should be able to have a conversation without some humorless scold like you coming around to nag us all the time! Who are you to tell us how you feel?\"</li>\n\n<li>\"Talking about this only makes the (insert community) community look bad! Why are you airing our dirty laundry? You're just doing this to get attention!\"</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>In effect, what you are saying is \"I refuse to take responsibility for what\nI said or did, and I'm going to place the blame on <em>you</em> the audience\nfor how you feel about it. I believe I am a good person, and I can't reconcile\nthe idea that I might have done something wrong, so my cognitive dissonance\nwill instead claim that <em>everyone else in the world is wrong</em>, if\nnecessary, just to save face.\"</p>\n\n<p>You're better off saying \"I didn't mean to cause any offense,\" but even that\nis a weak apology, because it's not your <em>intention</em> that decides how\nother people will react. Yes, you get some credit for not telling other people how to feel, but it's still a weak response.</p>\n\n<p>The proper response is \"I'm sorry. I didn't think about how other people\nmight take this. I don't want to exclude other people unnecessarily, so I'll be\nmore cautious about what I say and do in the future.\"</p>\n\n<p>That's what a reasonable adult would do when caught in a mistake. That's how\nto defuse an honest mistake and not turn yourself into a pariah.</p>\n\n<p>(Yes, I assume you're a reasonable and thoughtful adult. You're capable of\nempathizing with other people even if they're not exactly the same as you. Even\nif you have self-diagnosed yourself with some sort of social interaction\ndisorder, I expect you to live up to this standard.)</p>\n\n<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>\n\n<p>No one's saying \"Don't have fun\" or \"Be bland and non-offensive.\" (I\nshouldn't have to write this, but I know some of you are still sliding down\nthat slippery slope argument. Stop it.)</p>\n\n<p>What we are saying is this: not everyone is like you. Not everyone likes\nwhat you like. Not everyone grew up the same way you grew up. Not everyone had\nthe same opportunities or skills or goals or education or experiences you did,\nso think about what you say and do and how it might affect other people before\nyou say or do it.</p>\n\n<p>If you make a mistake (everyone makes mistakes), at least make\n<em>honest</em> mistakes, and then own up to them quickly and honestly.</p>\n\n<p>That's it. That's not too onerous a burden for intelligent, capable, mature\nadults. It's just empathy after all.</p>"

4a95bbce-ce01-8261-c5ff-5eb0bfeacd00.description	"<p>Writing good tests for code you care about is a creative process as much as\nit is an engineering discipline. You sometimes must find a balance between\ndoing things the right way and doing things the effective way. The closer your\ntests are to the real usage patterns of your code the more accurate they are,\nbut the faster and easier, the better your tests are to help you find\ndefects.</p>\n\n<p>Slow but accurate tests won't get run, while fast bug buggy tests won't\nproduce any trust.</p>\n\n<p>This dichotomy is often obvious in tests which must interact with multiple\nparts of a system, such as a database and a business logic layer. While many\npeople say \"Pull out your favorite mock object library and get to work!\", <a\nhref=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2012/04/mock-objects-despoil-your-tests.html\">I\nfind mock objects are scalpels, not hammers</a>, in that you need them for only\na few specialized and precise operations, not a tool you'd use every day.</p>\n\n<p>Consider databases.</p>\n\n<p>One of my projects at work is a database-backed B2C web site. The schema is\nunder fairly active development (I deployed a new version of the site with a\nbig change to the schema an hour ago and have at least two more updates this\nweek). I have a version of the live database handy for testing purposes (with\nuser information scrubbed out, or where that's not possible, salted and\nhashed), but I almost never use it. (I only use it when verifying that a\ndeployment will succeed before performing the deployment.)</p>\n\n<p>Instead, I use <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?DBICx::TestDatabase\">DBICx::TestDatabase</a>\nand a hand-selected subset of data for all of the tests. <code>DBICx::TD</code>\ntakes my existing schema and creates a SQLite database in memory (not on the\ndisk at all) and returns a <code>DBIx::Class</code> schema object connected to\nthat database. My initialization code dumps in some fixture data, and then it's\nready to use in all of my tests.</p>\n\n<p>Again, that database is not on disk. This has at least two benefits. First,\nit's a lot faster than a database on disk, because it has to do less IO. Even\nif I'm very careful about wrapping operations in transactions, waiting for data\nto hit a platter is still a lot slower than waiting for data to hit RAM.\nSecond, every process has its own unique database in memory and there's no\ncontention for the disk or a single database file. My tests are trivially\nparallelizable in this respect.</p>\n\n<p>All of the setup code is in my test library, <code>t::DB</code>. (I could\n<code>use lib 't/lib';</code>, but I haven't needed that yet.) The relevant\ncode looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code><span class=\"Statement\">package</span><span class=\"Type\"> t::DB</span>;\n\n<span class=\"Statement\">use strict</span>;\n<span class=\"Statement\">use warnings</span>;\n\n<span class=\"Statement\">use </span>Try::Tiny;\n<span class=\"Statement\">use </span>DBICx::TestDatabase;\n<span class=\"Statement\">use </span>MyApp ();\n<span class=\"Statement\">use </span>Test::WWW::Mechanize::Catalyst <span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">MyApp</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span>;\n<span class=\"Statement\">use </span>File::Touch;\n\nmake_cached_components();\n\n<span class=\"Statement\">my</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$schema</span>;\n<span class=\"Statement\">sub </span><span class=\"Identifier\">make_schema </span>{ <span class=\"Identifier\">$schema</span> ||= DBICx::TestDatabase-&gt;new( <span class=\"Statement\">shift</span> ) }\n\n<span class=\"Statement\">sub </span><span class=\"Identifier\">install_test_database</span>\n{\n    <span class=\"Statement\">my</span> (<span class=\"Identifier\">$app</span>, <span class=\"Identifier\">$schema</span>) = <span class=\"Identifier\">@_</span>;\n    MyApp-&gt;model( <span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">DB</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span> )-&gt;schema( <span class=\"Identifier\">$schema</span> );\n    MyApp-&gt;<span class=\"Statement\">log</span>-&gt;disable( <span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">warn</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span> );\n}\n\n<span class=\"Statement\">sub </span><span class=\"Identifier\">import</span>\n{\n    <span class=\"Statement\">my</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$self</span>        = <span class=\"Statement\">shift</span>;\n    <span class=\"Statement\">my</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$appname</span>     = <span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">MyApp</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span>;\n    <span class=\"Statement\">my</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$schema_name</span> = <span class=\"Identifier\">$appname</span> . <span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">::Schema</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span>;\n    <span class=\"Statement\">my</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$schema</span>      = make_schema( <span class=\"Identifier\">$schema_name</span> );\n    install_test_database( <span class=\"Identifier\">$appname</span>, <span class=\"Identifier\">$schema</span> );\n\n    try\n    {\n        create_security_questions( <span class=\"Identifier\">$schema</span><span class=\"Identifier\">-&gt;resultset</span>( <span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">SecurityQuestion</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span> ) );\n        create_user_roles(         <span class=\"Identifier\">$schema</span><span class=\"Identifier\">-&gt;resultset</span>( <span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">Role</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span>       ) );\n        create_users(              <span class=\"Identifier\">$schema</span><span class=\"Identifier\">-&gt;resultset</span>( <span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">User</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span>       ) );\n        create_invitations(        <span class=\"Identifier\">$schema</span><span class=\"Identifier\">-&gt;resultset</span>( <span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">Invitation</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span> ) );\n        create_sectors(            <span class=\"Identifier\">$schema</span><span class=\"Identifier\">-&gt;resultset</span>( <span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">Sector</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span>     ) );\n        create_industries(         <span class=\"Identifier\">$schema</span><span class=\"Identifier\">-&gt;resultset</span>( <span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">Industry</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span>   ) );\n        create_stocks(             <span class=\"Identifier\">$schema</span><span class=\"Identifier\">-&gt;resultset</span>( <span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">Stock</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span>      ) );\n    }\n    catch\n    {\n        <span class=\"Statement\">my</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$exception</span> = <span class=\"Identifier\">$_</span>;\n        BAIL_OUT( <span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">Fixture creation failed: </span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span> . <span class=\"Identifier\">$exception</span> );\n    };\n\n    <span class=\"Comment\"># ...</span>\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>When a test file uses this library, the <code>import()</code> method creates\na new test database for my application's schema. (The schema classes are\nalready in memory thanks to the <code>use</code> lines which bring them in as a\ndependency of the app.) The <code>make_schema()</code> lines initialize a\nclosure variable containing the schema object.</p>\n\n<p>Before today, this code went to some contortions using <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Catalyst::Test\">Catalyst::Test</a> to swap\nthe existing application's schema with the generated schema, but now all it has\nto do is to call <code>install_test_database()</code>, and Catalyst behaves as\nif it had connected to the schema using the in-memory database from the\nstart.</p>\n\n<p>As a bonus, I removed a couple of dependencies and deleted a few lines of\nugly code.</p>\n\n<p>You can take this approach and use it on your own (unless you have complex\ndatabase logic SQLite can't handle, and even then I'd work with this design for\na long time before I gave it up voluntarily). You can take a more general\nprinciple from it as well: make it easy to swap components in and out of your\napplication. The schema layer adds business logic to my data storage, but it's\nalso valuable because it presents an interface between a database and my\napplication. Anything polymorphic (or even allomorphic) to that interface\nshould suffice to give me confidence between tests and deployed\napplication.</p>\n\n<p>(Of course the deployed database on disk has to match the schema in memory,\nbut I did mention we have another mechanism to test that.)</p>"

33c70014-7e54-c62c-b415-96d9e5bee1af.description	"<p>Today is Alan Turing&#8217;s 100th birthday. I&#8217;ve been thinking about him lately, in particular about a story that demonstrates the perils of working with genius.</p>\n<p>The story goes that, when Turing was working with the Manchester Baby (the first stored program computer ever built. Just) a colleague wrote the first ever assembler which would turn (relatively) human readable assembly language and turn it into the ones and zeroes of machine code that the machine could actually execute. He showed it to Turing, who blew up at him, ranting that using the computer to do &#8216;trivial&#8217; jobs like that were a massive waste of expensive computer time.</p>\n<p>The problem with working with a genius, from the point of view of more ordinary mortals, is that the genius has only a very rough idea of what is actually easy, and what is only easy to them. From today&#8217;s vantage point, when computers are as freely available as they are now, the idea of <em>not</em> letting the computer do the shitwork for you seems utterly ludicrous &#8211; programmer time is more valuable than computer time.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s less obvious is that the same was true in Turing&#8217;s time (when there was precisely one computer) too. It only takes one programmer to make a mistake in translating from assembler to machine code and run a job that, for instance, gets stuck in an infinite loop and you&#8217;ve probably wasted more computer time (and programmer time) than if you&#8217;d just run it through the assembler in the first place. Turing didn&#8217;t see that, because the process of translating from symbols to binary wasn&#8217;t something that he found particularly complicated. To him, what was needed wasn&#8217;t more and better tools, it was more and better Turings.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not entirely sure that I believe the story (and I can&#8217;t remember where I heard it, so it may be a phantom of my memory). It certainly doesn&#8217;t chime with the Turing who was instrumental in mechanising the shitwork of finding the days rotor settings so that Enigma traffic could be cracked. The history of Bletchley Park is a story of building better and better machines to do the dully repetitive jobs that humans find so hard to stick to and which machines excel at.</p>\n<p>The &#8220;Just write code without bugs in the first place&#8221; school of programming is alive and well today. It&#8217;s not my school though. I&#8217;m very much an exploratory coder. I like to have tests to show me the way and to keep me honest so that I don&#8217;t go breaking things when I change this bit here. I&#8217;ve customised my editing environment to help me as much as possible. I have a nasty habit of writing bare words that I should have quoted, so I have a keystroke that shoves the last word into quotes for me. Another keystroke will align all the broad arrows at the current level of nesting. I&#8217;ve got snippets set up that fill in standard boilerplate when I start a new class, a huge list of common spelling mistakes that get autocorrected while I&#8217;m not looking and an expanding list of other little helpers that I need to write when I get around to it. Automation lets me go faster, make more and better mistakes and recover from them faster. I am a of little brain and I want all the help I can give myself.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure that Turing would be in the same camp as me.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the thing though &#8211; Turing was, definitely, a genius. But his paper &#8220;On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem&#8221; (the one that gave the world the Turing Machine) has a bug in it. In fact, it has two. The first is obvious enough that I spotted it when i read the paper for the first time. The second bug is rather more subtle (but still fixable. It&#8217;s okay, the field of computing is not build on sand).</p>\n<p>I love that The Paper &#8211; The one that&#8217;s the theoretical basis for the modern world (first publishd 75 years ago, round(ish) number fans) &#8211; has a bug. It gives me a strange kind of hope. Fallibility gets us all &#8211; even people who have saved the world. I think we should celebrate the humanity as well as the genius. Turing was, by all accounts, a very odd fish, but the world is undeniably richer for his contributions.</p>\n<p>So, let&#8217;s raise a glass to the memory of Alan Turing tonight, marathon runner, gay icon, saviour of the world and the pleasantly fallible inventor of the modern world. Not a bad CV, when you think about it.</p>\n<h4>Updated</h4>\n<p>Apparently I&#8217;m wrong about it being Turing who didn&#8217;t like the assembler but Von Neumann (another genius). See below for details. And phew! How nice to find that a hero doesn&#8217;t have feet of clay.</p>"

It just so happened that <span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span> (Yet Another Perl Conference) was held in Asheville this year, the week before the gathering&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.swangathering.com/Catalog/TS/sgtssched.html\">Traditional Song Week</a>. Well, I&#8217;m a perl hacker. I sing traditional songs. My employer was paying for me to attend <span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span> and were willing for me to extend my stay in America by a week. It was a no brainer really.</p>\n<p><span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span> was bloody good this year. Perl 5 development is moving forward and the community is buzzing because of it. Lots of &#8220;… and we&#8217;re hiring&#8221; slides. And that&#8217;s before we get to the pleasure of catching up with friends that I only see online most of the time. If you&#8217;re working in any field that has grassroots conferences associated with it, I can&#8217;t recommend attending them highly enough.</p>\n<h3>On to Swannanoa</h3>\n<p>At Swannanoa, I met Sheila Kay Adams and immediately switched my schedule to spend as much time singing with her as possible. Sheila&#8217;s a seventh generation ballad singer from the Sodom Laurel community in Madison Count. Her &#8220;grannie Berzil&#8221; Wallin remembered Cecil Sharp coming to Madison County and collecting songs from the family.</p>\n<p>Pedigree in singing shouldn&#8217;t matter, but it turns out it does. Sheila grew up in a community which was changing, but which still had old &#8216;love songs&#8217; as an important part of how it understood the world. Today, not so much. People still relate to the world and understand it through songs, but the songs are more likely to be contemporary. Lyrically, many of the love songs that Sheila and her family sing could have been written yesterday, but their performance is radically different from contemporary style. One voice, unaccompanied, a style that requires the listener to concentrate on the song rather than any aspects of production. Not something you&#8217;re going to dance to at your wedding, say.</p>\n<p>Sheila&#8217;s classes, on Meeting House Songs (more later) and her Ballads class with Bobbie McMillon were just wonderful; I won&#8217;t forget in a hurry the sound Bobbie singing &#8220;A conversation with Death&#8221; as a thunderstorm grumbled across the campus in the background. Spine tingling stuff. Sheila&#8217;s description of how she learned songs &#8220;knee to knee&#8221; has been helpful too. The way it would work was that the teacher and student would be sat out on the porch, often doing some chore or another, and the teacher would sing the first verse of a song. The student would sing it back and the teacher would sing the second verse. The student would then sing the first two verses then the teacher would sing the third verse and the student would sing the first three verses and so on, until the student was singing the whole song back to the teacher. A time consuming process to be sure, but it works.</p>\n<p>I know this because I learned Pretty Saro from a recording of Sheila&#8217;s late husband Jim Taylor, using a variant of the method, &#8220;knee to CD&#8221; if you like. I&#8217;d play the first verse, hit pause and sing it back, play the second verse, pause, repeat the first two… and so on. And in very short order I had the words and tune (up to a point; I listened back to that recording again recently and I&#8217;m singing a different tune now) and could start the process of actually <em>learning</em> the song, which involved singing it it lots, listening to other recordings, singing it some more and then taking the song out and trying it out in front of audiences and listening to what works and what doesn&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve never really finished learning a song; this recording is a snapshot. I hope you enjoy it.</p>"

be7eaa0c-5a26-36c0-41c0-c37b4b67f5da.description	"<p>I sometimes think that I should have published the lyrics to <a href=\"http://www.bofh.org.uk/child-of-the-library\">Child of the Library</a> with a bibliography. The references in the second verse are all obvious to me, but I&#8217;m a white middle class English boy who grew up around boats. My childhood reading and yours may not intersect all that much.</p>\n<p>So&#8230;</p>\n<h4>The Walkers and the Blacketts</h4>\n<p>Also known as the <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=intitle:%22Swallows+and+Amazons%22\">Swallows and Amazons.</a> <cite>Swallows and Amazons</cite> is the first &#8216;big&#8217; book that I can remember reading for myself. We were in Cornwall, holidaying at the same place my mum&#8217;s been going to since she was a kid. Mum was reading <cite>Swallows and Amazons</cite> to us, and it was great, but I was impatient to find out what happened next, so I took the book to bed with me and read it for myself. I haven&#8217;t stopped yet. <cite>Swallows and Amazons</cite> was the book that opened my door to reading for pleasure. It opened up a way of looking at the world too. I can&#8217;t imagine who I&#8217;d be if I&#8217;d never read any Ransome.</p>\n<h4>The Pevensies</h4>\n<p>The Pevensies are the family in <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=intitle:%22The+Lion+The+Witch+And+The+Wardrobe%22\">The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe,</a> the first of the Narnia books. I have a slightly troubled relationship with these books now. I <em>really</em> don&#8217;t get on with C. S. Lewis&#8217;s view of the world (I once hurled a taped reading of <cite>The Screwtape Letters</cite> out of the car rather than listen to another word of the bloody things), but I wasn&#8217;t reading between the lines when I was nine. I was just loving the stories and the images they put in my head. And what images&#8230;</p>\n<h4>Simp, the Canine Cannonball</h4>\n<p>What do you mean, you&#8217;ve never read <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=intitle:%22Cannonball+Simp%22\">Cannonball Simp?</a> You poor thing!</p>\n<p><cite>Cannonball Simp</cite>, by John Burningham is <em>the</em> library book for me. Back when I was 4 or 5, I would walk with my dad from Regent&#8217;s Square to the Doncaster Central Library every Saturday morning, with three books clutched under my arm. I&#8217;d hand them over the counter, receiving in exchange 3 buff cardboard library slip holders. I would then go over to the childrens&#8217; books section and pull out three new (to me) books and take them to the counter. The librarian would remove the slip from the library bookplate, place it in one of my surrendered holders and stamp the slip and the bookplate with the date, three weeks hence, by which the book must be renewed.</p>\n<p>Well, that&#8217;s how it worked until weekend I came back with <cite>Cannonball Simp</cite>. I <em>loved</em> it. I didn&#8217;t want to take it back because I hadn&#8217;t learned it yet. Sure I could &#8216;read&#8217; along with Dad &#8211; I knew all the words by then &#8211; but the pictures were another thing entirely. They were <em>beautiful</em>. They still are.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s when I learned of the magic of &#8216;renewal&#8217;. Instead of handing the book back, I showed it to the librarian and said &#8220;I&#8217;d like to renew this, please,&#8221; and instead of giving me my library card back, they just stamped the book and slip with a new date. Wow! It was like I <em>owned</em> the book.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know how many times I renewed that book. I&#8217;m afraid I don&#8217;t remember the words any more. But I still remember the pleasure that it gave me.</p>\n<h4>Galadriel the Fair</h4>\n<p>On the last day of junior school our form teacher, Miss Rees, wrote a long list of books on the board and asked us to copy the list into the back of our exercise books. She said that these were books we should try and read. I don&#8217;t have the exercise book any more and I remember very little of the list. I do remember that I&#8217;d already read some of them. And I remember <cite>The Hobbit</cite> and <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=intitle:%22The+Lord+of+the+Rings%22\">The Lord of the Rings</a>. Oh boy, do I remember <cite>The Hobbit</cite> and <cite>The Lord of the Rings</cite>.</p>\n<p>Terry Pratchett said that if you&#8217;re a 14 year old boy and you don&#8217;t think that The Lord of the Rings is the best book ever written then there may be something wrong with you, but if you&#8217;re 28 and you <em>still</em> think it&#8217;s the best book ever written then there&#8217;s <em>definitely</em> something wrong with you. I <em>was</em> that 14 year old boy. I stayed up all night reading it. I fell asleep reading it. I read the appendices. I worked out how to write my name in Elvish script. I even read <cite>The Silmarillion</cite> and thought I enjoyed it. I can still recite some of the poetry. In Elvish. I&#8217;ve forgotten the words of Cannonball Simp, but get me going with &#8220;A Elbereth Gilthoniel&#8230;&#8221; and I can just about reel off the rest of the poem. What&#8217;s wrong with me?</p>\n<p>By the time I was 28, LotR wasn&#8217;t the best book ever written. I&#8217;m no longer sure that there is such a thing as &#8220;The Best Book Ever Written&#8221;. Still, if you haven&#8217;t at least read <cite>The Hobbit</cite> you should take steps to rectify matters. Or wait for the Peter Jackson movie.</p>\n<h4>The Daughter of a Pirate King</h4>\n<p>Confession time: I haven&#8217;t read <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=intitle:%22Pippi+Longstocking%22\">Pippi Longstocking</a>. The &#8216;I&#8217; of <cite>A Child of the Library</cite> is a composite of Gill and me. <cite>Pippi Longstocking</cite> was her Nancy Blackett. The  <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=Bastable+inauthor:Nesbit\">Bastables</a> were her Pevensies.</p>\n<h4>Paddington the Bear</h4>\n<p>Once I&#8217;d learned that reading for myself was pure pleasure, I read anything and everything I could find in the library and I discovered Michael Bond&#8217;s <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=intitle:Paddington+inauthor:%22Michael+Bond%22\">Paddington Bear</a>. Paddington was a well meaning young bear from Peru who was found, wearing a duffel coat and a label reading &#8220;Please look after this bear&#8221;, at Paddington Station by the Brown Family. The Browns took him in immediately, named him Paddington after the station and&#8230; &#8216;hijinks ensue&#8217;.</p>\n<p>I would be quietly reading these books to myself when some episode or another (&#8220;Baked Elastic&#8221;; the Russian ballet dancer; the wobbly table&#8230;) would cause me to laugh out loud and my brother would demand to know what was funny and made me read whatever it was aloud to him. I have to confess, I resented this, but not enough to dent my enjoyment. The Paddington books are made of joy.</p>"

2e574213-56d4-4f37-f95c-441cc202c325.description	"<p>Or… what I did this summer.</p>\n<p>Summer as been frantic. Mostly joyous, but frantic.</p>\n<p>I had talks accepted at both <a href=\"http://www.yapc2011.us/yn2011/\"><span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span></a> and <a href=\"http://oscon.com/\"><span class=\"caps\">OSCON</span></a>. Because <span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span> was in Asheville, and the <a href=\"http://www.swangathering.com/\">Swannanoa Gathering</a> Traditional Song Week fell the week after <span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span>, that meant I flew out to Asheville for an intense fortnight of Perl community engagement followed by a week spent singing myself hoarse and being blown away by <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/sheilakayadams\">Sheila Kay Adams&#8217;s</a> singing and her stories of mountain life and listening to future stars like <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/sheilakayadams\">Sam Gleaves</a> and inspiring activists like <a href=\"http://www.blairpathways.com/\">Saro Lynch Thomason</a>. I could write entire posts on every one of those, and that&#8217;s before I get on to the magic of watching the sun go down and the fireflies come up from the grass of the Warren Wilson College&#8217;s natural amphitheatre. Magical so it was.</p>\n<p>On the last night of the gathering, there was a student showcase. Of course, I sang <a href=\"http://www.bofh.org.uk/child-of-the-library\">Child of the Library</a>. Rather embarrassingly, I skipped a verse, but the response was great. Several people came up to me afterwards and told me their library stories and, I hope, went home with a determination to help protect their libraries.</p>\n<p>Then it was back to the UK for a fortnight before heading off again to <span class=\"caps\">OSCON</span> in Portland, OR. I was down to give two talks, one on <a href=\"http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011/public/schedule/detail/17872\">Higher Order Javascript</a> and a second on <a href=\"http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011/public/schedule/detail/18577\">Polymorphic Dispatch</a> which proved to be a bear to write. I&#8217;d planned to have everything done and dusted and the slides learned by the time I flew out, but spent a huge amount of time blocked on how I was going to present the ideas using a motivating problem that hit the sweet spot between too simple and too complicated. It wasn&#8217;t until I arrived in Portland and talked things through with my host, <a href=\"http://www.justatheory.com/\">David Wheeler</a>, that I got that worked out. The slides were written in a tearing rush and weren&#8217;t as good as I would like them to be. I still owe the talk attendees a full writeup, so I&#8217;ll take this opportunity to apologise for the lateness and promise that a writeup <em>will</em> arrive. The Javascript talk was based on one I&#8217;ve given before, but I&#8217;m starting to realise that it&#8217;s a full tutorial masquerading as a short talk. More on that later, I hope.</p>\n<p>What with flapping about the unwritten talk, and the 10 minute gap between them, I didn&#8217;t really worry overmuch about the Perl lightning talks. It&#8217;s been my practice to sing a lightly massaged version of <a href=\"http://LOUANDPETER.COM/\">Lou and Peter Berryman&#8217;s</a> very splendid song <cite>A Chat With Your Mother</cite> with tailored verses about different language communities and various Perl luminaries. I <em>had</em> decided to retire it, but at <span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span> I came up with a snide verse about myself and another about Larry Wall, so it felt renewed enough to be worth singing this year as well. I ended up singing Child of the Library again.</p>\n<p>The response was phenomenal. I&#8217;ve been singing it for long enough now that I know it <em>gets</em> people. Hell, when I was writing it, there were verses that were hard to sing because they got me and I was choking up as I tried to sing them. But the lightning talk got a standing ovation. Again people were telling me library stories and I found that the UK isn&#8217;t the only country with local governments stupid enough to consider closing libraries, it was happening in the US too. So, fired up by that response, I went to see Sarah Novotny and begged her for five minutes on the <span class=\"caps\">OSCON</span> stage before the closing keynote. Bless her, she let me have it.</p>\n<h3>Pics, or it didn&#8217;t happen!</h3>\n<p>I have proof too! The main stage at O&#8217;Reilly events has serious video equipment pointed at it. Because it&#8217;s important that people get to see serious talks about <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnX5v0uwNjc&amp;list=PL93FC98105B19725C&amp;index=39&amp;feature=plpp\">known bugs and exploits in wetware</a>. Because my performance wasn&#8217;t on the schedule, and I didn&#8217;t have a video release all signed and ready to go beforehand, it&#8217;s taken a while to get the video available. But last night, that changed, so here I am, in all my corpulent glory. Enjoy. And please, spread this video as far and as wide as you can. Libraries are important.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"345\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/MDi5JtS1H-g\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>"

This happens as I sing  it out to different audiences and find out which bits work, which bits are hard to sing and all the other little details that you only find out when there&#8217;s a living, breathing, listening and (hopefully) singing audience in front of you.</p>\n<p>It turns out that the same things happens with songs I&#8217;ve written.</p>\n<p>The biggest stumbling block of the original version is the last line of the first verse:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My wife met Pippi Langstumpf, I met Paddington the Bear</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Someone on the comment thread suggested:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Heidi, Pippi Longstocking and Paddington the Bear</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which is fine, except that means singing &#8216;PIPpi LONGstockING&#8217;, and I&#8217;m not happy with putting the emphasis on the <span class=\"caps\">WRONG</span> sylLABles if I can possibly help it. In the revised version, I think I&#8217;ve cracked it. The line is now:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The daughter of a pirate king and Paddington the bear</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which is <em>much</em> easier to sing and follows the rest of the verse by being a more oblique reference to the character. If you know who Pippi is, then it&#8217;s obvious who I&#8217;m singing about. If you don&#8217;t, then maybe I&#8217;ve piqued your curiosity.</p>\n<p>The first recording also had two slightly different tunes for the verses, this version has settled on just the one.</p>\n<p>And, for people who care about that sort of thing, this was recorded with a click track at 110bpm rather than speeding up over the course of the song, which should make life a little easier for anyone taking part in Rabid Gravy&#8217;s <a href=\"http://blog.rabidgravy.com/making-music-to-save-our-libraries\">project</a> to remix and rerecord different versions of the song.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re concerned about Library closures, a good place to start is <a href=\"http://www.voicesforthelibrary.org.uk/\">Voices for the Library</a>. If you&#8217;re on twitter, you might also start following <a href=\"http://twitter.com/ukpling\">@ukpling</a>. If you&#8217;re not concerned about library closures, why on earth did you read this far, and what kind of excuse for a human being are you?</p>"

Frankly, instrumentation scares me, I&#8217;m much happier singing unaccompanied but I realise I&#8217;m in a minority on this.</p>\n<p>When you sing it, try making the song your own by changing things to suit your own. Julie Chilton&#8217;s posted an alternate first verse in the comments, but the world is the mollusc of your choice.</p>\n<p>The &#8216;I&#8217; in the song, isn&#8217;t <em>quite</em> me and it isn&#8217;t quite Gill either. Most importantly, both of us grew up in houses where no book was out of bounds. Our fathers used to take us to our respective local libraries (Lewisham for Gill, Doncaster Central and then Bawtry for me) every week or so on a Saturday morning. As soon as I was old enough, I&#8217;d ride my bike from our home in Scrooby to Bawtry with a carrier full of books hanging off the handlebars. Bawtry is currently in the crosshairs of Doncaster&#8217;s idiot mayor &#8211; the bloke who suggested getting kindles for everyone instead &#8211; along with 13 other libraries in the district.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a revised version of the recording with additional notes at: http://www.bofh.org.uk/2011/04/04/a-child-of-the-library-revised, or just press play:</p>\n<p><object height=\"81\" width=\"100%\"> <param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F13031396\"></param> <param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param> <embed allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"81\" src=\"http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F13031396\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed> </object>  <span><a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/pdcawley/child-of-the-library-revised\">Child Of The Library (Revised)</a> by <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/pdcawley\">pdcawley</a></span></p>\n<h5>August 9th 2011</h5>\n<p>I&#8217;ve updated the lyrics here to reflect what I sing now.

b3e1c251-7802-38a6-5afd-b05e49748711.description	"<p>I haven't written an infinite loop bug in a while. I suppose I was due. (The Greek gods always punish hubris.)</p>\n\n<p>I have a database table full of users. Let's call that table\n<code>user</code>. A user has one or more roles (from the <code>role</code>)\ntable. A user can be an unverified user, a free user, a subscriber, or an\nadministrator. (Administrators obviously are also subscribers, but you get the\npoint.)</p>\n\n<p>I use <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?DBIx::Class\">DBIx::Class</a>\nfor the database access layer. My <code>User</code> result class has a couple\nof methods which let other model actions query whether the user can perform\nspecific operations. They're <a\nhref=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2011/05/decoupling-testability-and-synthetic-attributes.html\">synthetic\nattributes</a>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>has [<span class=\"Constant\">qw(</span><span class=\"Constant\"> is_admin is_subscriber </span><span class=\"Constant\">)</span>], <span class=\"Constant\">is</span> =&gt; <span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">ro</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span>, <span class=\"Constant\">lazy_build</span> =&gt; <span class=\"Constant\">1</span>;\n\n<span class=\"Statement\">sub </span><span class=\"Identifier\">_build_is_admin      </span>{ <span class=\"Statement\">shift</span>-&gt;find_role_by_name( <span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">admin</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span>      ) }\n<span class=\"Statement\">sub </span><span class=\"Identifier\">_build_is_subscriber </span>{ <span class=\"Statement\">shift</span>-&gt;find_role_by_name( <span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">subscriber</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span> ) }</code></pre>\n\n<p>Obviously the implementation of <code>find_role_by_name()</code> is\nsupremely important. Here's how I originally wrote the code (no sense blaming\nanyone else for this, because <em>I</em> wrote all of the access control code\nmyself.) See if you can catch the bug:</p>\n\n<pre><code><span class=\"Statement\">sub </span><span class=\"Identifier\">find_role_by_name</span>\n{\n    <span class=\"Statement\">my</span> (<span class=\"Identifier\">$self</span>, <span class=\"Identifier\">$name</span>) = <span class=\"Identifier\">@_</span>;\n\n    <span class=\"Statement\">while</span> (<span class=\"Statement\">my</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$role</span> = <span class=\"Identifier\">$self</span><span class=\"Identifier\">-&gt;user_roles-&gt;next</span>)\n    {\n        <span class=\"Statement\">return</span> <span class=\"Constant\">1</span> <span class=\"Statement\">if</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$role</span><span class=\"Identifier\">-&gt;role-&gt;name</span> <span class=\"Statement\">eq</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$name</span>;\n    }\n\n    <span class=\"Statement\">return</span> <span class=\"Constant\">0</span>;\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>As a hint, the <code>user_roles</code> method represents the relationship\nbetween the <code>user</code> table and the <code>role</code> table. That\nmethod returns a DBIC resultset which represents the entries in the table with\na foreign key to the <code>user</code> table.</p>\n\n<p>See the bug yet? It took me a while. The problem is that <em>every\ninvocation of the loop</em> fetches a new resultset. Every invocation of the\nloop fetches only the <em>first</em> result from that resultset.</p>\n\n<p>My tests (yeah, I wrote the tests too, before I wrote this code in fact,\njust like you're supposed to do) didn't catch that because the rest of the code\nonly ever checked for one user role, the administrator role, anywhere else.\nOnly when I added code for the subscriber role did the subscription tests\ntrigger this infinite loop. (Now how abhorred in my imagination is that most\nexcellent jest!)</p>\n\n<p>I wish I could say that I diagnosed the cause immediately. I didn't. I\nstared at the code for far too long, until I had the presence of mind to put a\ndebugging statement in the loop body to print the name of the role.  (Stat\nofficium pristina nomine.)</p>\n\n<p>Here's the corrected code, with a single expression hoisted into a scalar\nvariable where it may endure properly:</p>\n\n<pre><code><span class=\"Statement\">sub </span><span class=\"Identifier\">find_role_by_name</span>\n{\n    <span class=\"Statement\">my</span> (<span class=\"Identifier\">$self</span>, <span class=\"Identifier\">$name</span>) = <span class=\"Identifier\">@_</span>;\n    <span class=\"Statement\">my</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$user_roles_rs</span> = <span class=\"Identifier\">$self</span><span class=\"Identifier\">-&gt;user_roles</span>;\n\n    <span class=\"Statement\">while</span> (<span class=\"Statement\">my</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$role</span> = <span class=\"Identifier\">$user_roles_rs</span><span class=\"Identifier\">-&gt;next</span>)\n    {\n        <span class=\"Statement\">return</span> <span class=\"Constant\">1</span> <span class=\"Statement\">if</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$role</span><span class=\"Identifier\">-&gt;role-&gt;name</span> <span class=\"Statement\">eq</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$name</span>;\n    }\n\n    <span class=\"Statement\">return</span> <span class=\"Constant\">0</span>;\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>I will say this: expecting your test suite to pass in under 30 seconds makes this sort of thing much easier to catch. If I'd had to wait for a continuous integration server to get around to checking this commit, I wouldn't have fixed it as quickly as I did.</p>\n\n<p>Then again, it's easier to debug bugs you never write in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>Oh, and if you catch the literary allusion in the title, here's your prize:\ncongratulations! You might be overeducated. (If you caught the other three\nallusions, have you ever noticed how much Pynchon's <em>V</em> influenced\nStephenson's <em>Cryptonomicon</em>?)</p>"

ea2a900c-c1dc-7576-5ba1-e68823b63693.description	"<p>In <a\nhref=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2012/08/speeding-up-my-test-suite-by-25.html\">Speeding\nUp My Test Suite by 25%</a>, I lamented that writing modern Perl code often\nmeans using code which mangles the language at <code>use</code> time. Consider\ntypical Moose code:</p>\n\n<pre><code><span class=\"Statement\">package</span><span class=\"Type\"> MyApp::App::Role::HasMailer</span>;\n<span class=\"Comment\"># ABSTRACT: role which provides other app roles with a mailer</span>\n\n<span class=\"Statement\">use </span>Modern::Perl;\n<span class=\"Statement\">use </span>Moose::Role;\n\n<span class=\"Statement\">use </span>MyApp::Mailer;\n\nhas <span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">mailer</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span>, <span class=\"Constant\">is</span> =&gt; <span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">ro</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span>, <span class=\"Constant\">lazy_build</span> =&gt; <span class=\"Constant\">1</span>;\n\n<span class=\"Statement\">sub </span><span class=\"Identifier\">_build_mailer</span>\n{\n    <span class=\"Statement\">my</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$self</span>        = <span class=\"Statement\">shift</span>;\n    <span class=\"Statement\">my</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$config</span>      = <span class=\"Statement\">do</span> <span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">myapp_local.pl</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span>;\n    <span class=\"Statement\">my</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$mail_client</span> = <span class=\"Identifier\">$config-&gt;{</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">Model::UserMail</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Identifier\">}</span><span class=\"Identifier\">{</span><span class=\"Constant\">mail_client</span><span class=\"Identifier\">}</span>;\n    <span class=\"Statement\">return</span> MyApp::Mailer-&gt;new( <span class=\"Identifier\">$mail_client</span> );\n}\n\n<span class=\"Constant\">1</span>;</code></pre>\n\n<p>... where functions such as <code>has</code> and <code>with</code> and\n<code>extends</code> look like declarations (such as <code>my</code> and\n<code>sub</code>), but are actually code to run.</p>\n\n<p>The difference is important. A declaration that's part of the language's\ngrammar need only be <em>parsed</em> to have its effects take place, while a\nstatement or expression needs to <em>run</em> to take place.</p>\n\n<p>This is, of course, why variable declarations makes lexical scoping trivial\nto understand for experienced Perl programmers, why binding closures to their\nlexical environments is easy in the simple cases, and why binding closures to\ntheir lexical environments when you use the STRING form of <code>eval</code> is\nso difficult.</p>\n\n<p>As Moose hackers will tell you, Moose isn't a simple preprocessor you run\nover your code once to generate <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Moose::Manual::Unsweetened\">longer, uglier\ncode without syntactic goodness</a>. Instead, <a\nhref=\"http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=685459\">classes are built, not\ndeclared</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This is endemic to Moose, but it's not a characteristic specific to Modern\nPerl. It's inherent in Perl 5 itself, even the 1994 version. <a\nhref=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2009/08/how-a-perl-5-program-works.html\">Perl\n5 lets you run arbitrary code while parsing happens</a>.</p>\n\n<p>While you can gain tremendous flexibility with this approach (building up\nclosures with partially applied arguments to export to caller namespaces), you\ncan't serialize the resulting code as easily because you may have to run\narbitrary code to restore your program in memory.</p>\n\n<p>Put another way, <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Exporter\">Exporter</a> is a library while\nit should be core language behavior.</p>\n\n<p>In the simple case where a library wants to export a couple of symbols into\nthe caller's namespace, say <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> from <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?List::Util\">List::Util</a>, why is there\nno simple syntax for marking those symbols as exportable in\n<code>List::Util</code> without having to run code (or worse yet, <em>inherit\nfrom</em>) <code>Exporter</code>?</p>\n\n<p>If a declarative syntax existed&mdash;with language support or at least the\nbroad consistency to allow for tool support&mdash;such that it were statically\npossible to determine the symbols exported from one package and imported into\nanother package, precompilation would be easier. A module could have a static\nlist of exports provided in a manifest of sorts. (A good optimizer could even\ndecline to import unused code!)</p>\n\n<p>I realize it isn't always possible to reduce all cases of exporting to a\nlist of static symbols (nor is it desirable to remove that power), but at least\n80% of the code I write would benefit from this. We'd also be able to have\nbetter tool support for the language; it would be easier to discover which\nsymbols come from where, and we might even close the \"You can't always tell\nwhich of two interpretations of a parse tree is valid in Perl 5 code thanks to\n<code>import</code> and <code>BEGIN</code>\" gap a little further.</p>\n\n<p>(... but then someone will ask why <code>strict</code> is a pragma and not\ncore language behavior, especially after looking at its implementation, and\nthen we'll all go to the paint store to pick out our favorite colors. See also \"I didn't provide an example of this declarative syntax, so you can't argue about it in the comments.\")</p>"

ede5f5ff-5371-58ce-3440-932bf77d4ba5.description	"<p>One of my work projects has a test suite that's grown a little too slow for\nmy liking. With only a few hundred tests, I've seen our test runs take over 30\nseconds in a couple of cases. We're diligent about separating tests into\nindividual logical files, so that when we work on a feature we can run only its\ntests as we develop and save running the whole suite for the last verification\nbefore checkin, but 30 seconds is still too long.</p>\n\n<p>(Before you ask, <a\nhref=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2011/11/parallelism-and-test-suites.html\">our\ntest suite is fully parallelizable</a>, so that 30 seconds keeps all of the\ncores on a development box at full usage.)</p>\n\n<p>I realize that one fad in software of the last few years is continuous\nintegration, where you submit your commits to a box somewhere for that to run\nthe full test suite and email you if something goes wrong, sometime in the\nfuture, hopefully less than an hour from now. Hopefully.</p>\n\n<p>We can't afford to wait that long to know if our code is right. (I like to\npush to our production box as soon as we have well-tested fixes that we know\nwork reliably. That's often more than once per day. I'm the only one working on\nthe site today, and I've already pushed three changes, with at least one more\ncoming.)</p>\n\n<p>When I worked on <a href=\"http://parrotcode.org/\">Parrot</a>, I spent a lot\nof time profiling the VM to sneak out small performance improvements here and\nthere, using less memory and far fewer CPU cycles. I'm at home in a profiler,\nso I picked a very small test program and ran it through <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Devel::NYTProf\">Devel::NYTProf</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I've mentioned before that this application has a <a\nhref=\"http://catalystframework.org/\">Catalyst</a> frontend which takes full\nadvantage of <a href=\"http://moose.perl.org/\">Moose</a> throughout. It uses <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?DBIx::Class\">DBIx::Class</a> as its\npersistence layer.</p>\n\n<p>As you might expect, <em>startup</em> time dominates most of the tests. We\nhave 21 individual test files, and startup took close to two seconds for each\nof them. No matter how much we parallelized, we were always going to spend no\nless than 40 total seconds running tests. (The non-parallel test suite runs in\n~67 seconds, so parallelization already gives a 55% improvement.)</p>\n\n<p>When I looked at the profile, I saw that most of the startup time came from\na couple of dependencies we didn't need.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, even though I use <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?HTML::FormHandler\">HTML::FormHandler</a>\nquite happily on another project, we don't use it on this project at all. We\ndid use a Catalyst plugin which brought it in as a dependency, but we never\nused that feature.</p>\n\n<p>I spent an hour revising that part of our application to remove that plugin\n(which we used to use, then customized our code so that the plugin was almost\nvestigial) and the parallel test run went down to 23 seconds.</p>\n\n<p>We trimmed 10% of our dependencies, just by removing one plugin and the code\nit brought in.</p>\n\n<p>(Tip: use <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Devel::TraceUse\">Devel::TraceUse</a> to\nfind out which modules load which modules. It's a good way to get the\nconceptual weight of a dependency.)</p>\n\n<p>I don't shy away from dependencies when they're useful, but I ended up\nrevising one file and ending up with <em>less</em> code overall than we had\nbefore I started.</p>\n\n<p>With that said, there's clearly room for improvement. I traced through some\nMoose code which handles initialization (especially of attributes) and it seems\nlike there should be some efficiency gains there. Similarly, both Catalyst and\nDBIC go through some contortions to load plugins and components that in my case\nwere unnecessary. (I have a patch to consider for the former, but not the\nlatter.)</p>\n\n<p>Two things I learned do bother me somewhat. If you use\n<code>Devel::TraceUse</code> on a project of any size, you'll see a lot of\ninconsistency and duplication, thanks to years of TIMTOWTDI. Catalyst brings in\nMoose, but DBIC eventually ends up bringing in <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Moo\">Moo</a>. No one can decide whether to\nuse <code>@ISA</code> or <code>use base '...';</code> or <code>use parent\n'...';</code>. A lot of larger projects (DateTime, Moose extensions) have lots\nof helper modules spread out in lots of tiny <em>.pm</em> files which each need\nto be located, loaded, and compiled.</p>\n\n<p>Worse, all of the nice declarative syntax you get with some of these modern\nlibraries has a cost behind the scenes every time you run the program <em>even\nif nothing has changed</em>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=990666\">If I were to pick an\noptimization target for future versions of Perl 5</a>, I'd want a good way for\nMoose or Catalyst or whatever to precompile my nice sugared code into a cached\nrepresentation that could then load faster on subsequent invocations. (I know\nyou're not getting an order of magnitude improvement here: you still have to\nset up stubs for metaclasses and the like, but even getting attributes and\nmethods in place would be an improvement!)</p>\n\n<p>I'd settle today for a preforking test suite that doesn't require me to\nrewrite all of my tests.</p>\n\n<p>Then again, that ~25% improvement in test execution from removing one\ndependency isn't bad for the week either.</p>"

bf135223-5e7a-ea60-4bcd-71576b33a91a.description	"<p>In the persistent and recurring debate over <a\nhref=\"http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Incidents\">rudeness,\nharassment, and other exclusionary events in technical circles</a>, there's\nalways that one persnickety little argument. You know the one.</p>\n\n<blockquote><em>You shouldn't feel offended. That's just silly.</em></blockquote>\n\n<h2>Yet Another Bad Example</h2>\n\n<p>Take, for example, <a href=\"http://stripgenerator.com/strip/597425/moose-moore-or-mouse/\">a cartoon comparing the Moose object system to elective breast enhancement surgery and the attractiveness of an actress before and after such surgery</a>. (Hmm, it's even <em>less</em> amusing when I describe it that way.)</p>\n\n<p>As you might rightly imagine, several people winced at <a\nhref=\"http://blogs.perl.org/users/joe_mcmahon1/2012/08/why-im-considering-dropping-perlmonks.html\">yet\nanother incident of the sexualization of something that's not sexual at\nall</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As you might sadly expect, the responses to that incident were <a\nhref=\"http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=989177\">attempts to wave away any\ndisagreement by dismissing the possibility anyone might feel any justified\noffense or exclusion or discomfort</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you're playing <a href=\"http://www.derailingfordummies.com/\">derailment</a> bingo, grab an extra card.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't difficult, my friends. It's actually very simple.</p>\n\n<h2>The Unnecessary Sexualization of Technology</h2>\n\n<p>People have sex. Yes, everyone understands that. Most of us in the world of\ntechnology are adults, or at least have gone through puberty. Everyone\nunderstands that too.</p>\n\n<p>Yet when I as a heterosexual adult male go to a conference or a user group\nmeeting or participate in a mailing list or a web forum or an IRC channel\n<em>devoted to technology</em>, I have no desire to talk about sex. Even though\nat least 90% of the other participants are likely straight adult males like me,\nthe purpose of the group has nothing to do with sex or sexuality.</p>\n\n<p>Now imagine that you're not in that 90% group and you want to talk about\ntechnology, but you have to wade through discussions of things that are\ncompletely unrelated, sensitive, and which continually point out to you that\nyou are very different from that group. Constantly.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine going to an event where your nametag says \"I don't belong\" and every\nconversation you try to have starts with the other person saying \"Hi! You don't\nbelong here! How are you today?\"</p>\n\n<p>(I went to a charity auction earlier this year where the bids started at\nmultiple thousands of dollars for packages like a week's vacation on a private\nisland and a chartered flight to one of the world's top golf spots. They had a\nwine wall where some bottles cost more than my suit. I left before dessert. I\ndidn't belong.)</p>\n\n<p>If you try to justify the sexualization of technology with \"It's just a\njoke\" or \"It's a beautiful, normal part of human existence\" or \"Lighten up\",\nyou're behaving rudely. Please stop.</p>\n\n<p>If you're thinking of complaining \"But this means we can't talk about other\nthings we like, like Dr. Who or comic books! Why are you censoring us? How\nboring it would be to talk about technology alone all the time!\" then you're\ncommitting the slippery slope fallacy and demonstrating a false equivalence\nfallacy. Please instead discuss things like a rational adult with listening and\nreasoning skills.</p>\n\n<h2>Only I Get to Define \"Offensiveness\"</h2>\n\n<p>If telling other people they don't belong isn't bad enough, my favorite\nexhibit of bad behavior is telling people their feelings don't matter because\nonly you get to decide what they can find offensive or exclusionary or mean-spirited or inappropriate.</p>\n\n<p>This happens in many ways. (This list is <em>not</em> exhaustive.)</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\"But I asked a (insert token member of the group you supposedly \"offended\" here) and they said it was okay.</li>\n\n<li>\"It's just a joke, lighten up.\"</li>\n\n<li>\"You're misunderstanding the joke.\"</li>\n\n<li>\"You don't have a sense of humor.\"</li>\n\n<li>\"There's no logical reason for you to feel offended.\"</li>\n\n<li>\"You're making too big a deal out of this.\"</li>\n\n<li>\"You're making (insert the group you supposedly \"offended\" here) out to be humorless prigs, all too ready to jump on honest, good-hearted, handsome people like me, and you're shrill and probably no fun to hang out with in person too.\"</li>\n\n<li>\"I'm not as bad as (Hitler). Get some perspective.\"</li>\n\n<li>\"(Insert some other bad thing here which you perceive to be a bigger problem) is a bigger problem in the world. Why don't you solve that first?\"</li>\n\n<li>\"Everyone I know in person says I'm not (insert some epithet), therefore I\ncan never exhibit this bad behavior you ascribe to me. Thus it never happened.\nQED.\"</li>\n\n<li>\"Everyone's offended by something, so if we always sought to avoid offense, we'd never do anything. Therefore doing anything is going to offend, so you really need to get over it.\"</li>\n\n<li>\"Everyone else is stupid except me. Everyone else is an unenlightened boor except me. Bow down before your cultural and moral superior.\"</li>\n\n<li>\"If you interpreted it that way, it's <em>your</em> mind with the problem. Takes one to know one.\"</li>\n\n<li>\"You're the only one complaining. Silence implies consent. Therefore it's\nnot really a big deal!\"</li>\n\n<li>\"(Insert some group underrepresented in the community) don't like (the focus of the community) anyway. So what's the problem?\"</li>\n\n<li>\"You're acting like a patronizing nanny, and we reasonable adults should be able to have a conversation without some humorless scold like you coming around to nag us all the time! Who are you to tell us how you feel?\"</li>\n\n<li>\"Talking about this only makes the (insert community) community look bad! Why are you airing our dirty laundry? You're just doing this to get attention!\"</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>In effect, what you are saying is \"I refuse to take responsibility for what\nI said or did, and I'm going to place the blame on <em>you</em> the audience\nfor how you feel about it. I believe I am a good person, and I can't reconcile\nthe idea that I might have done something wrong, so my cognitive dissonance\nwill instead claim that <em>everyone else in the world is wrong</em>, if\nnecessary, just to save face.\"</p>\n\n<p>You're better off saying \"I didn't mean to cause any offense,\" but even that\nis a weak apology, because it's not your <em>intention</em> that decides how\nother people will react. Yes, you get some credit for not telling other people how to feel, but it's still a weak response.</p>\n\n<p>The proper response is \"I'm sorry. I didn't think about how other people\nmight take this. I don't want to exclude other people unnecessarily, so I'll be\nmore cautious about what I say and do in the future.\"</p>\n\n<p>That's what a reasonable adult would do when caught in a mistake. That's how\nto defuse an honest mistake and not turn yourself into a pariah.</p>\n\n<p>(Yes, I assume you're a reasonable and thoughtful adult. You're capable of\nempathizing with other people even if they're not exactly the same as you. Even\nif you have self-diagnosed yourself with some sort of social interaction\ndisorder, I expect you to live up to this standard.)</p>\n\n<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>\n\n<p>No one's saying \"Don't have fun\" or \"Be bland and non-offensive.\" (I\nshouldn't have to write this, but I know some of you are still sliding down\nthat slippery slope argument. Stop it.)</p>\n\n<p>What we are saying is this: not everyone is like you. Not everyone likes\nwhat you like. Not everyone grew up the same way you grew up. Not everyone had\nthe same opportunities or skills or goals or education or experiences you did,\nso think about what you say and do and how it might affect other people before\nyou say or do it.</p>\n\n<p>If you make a mistake (everyone makes mistakes), at least make\n<em>honest</em> mistakes, and then own up to them quickly and honestly.</p>\n\n<p>That's it. That's not too onerous a burden for intelligent, capable, mature\nadults. It's just empathy after all.</p>"

8d85a2cc-f0f1-7234-73af-79dea58dd6d0.description	"<p>Writing good tests for code you care about is a creative process as much as\nit is an engineering discipline. You sometimes must find a balance between\ndoing things the right way and doing things the effective way. The closer your\ntests are to the real usage patterns of your code the more accurate they are,\nbut the faster and easier, the better your tests are to help you find\ndefects.</p>\n\n<p>Slow but accurate tests won't get run, while fast bug buggy tests won't\nproduce any trust.</p>\n\n<p>This dichotomy is often obvious in tests which must interact with multiple\nparts of a system, such as a database and a business logic layer. While many\npeople say \"Pull out your favorite mock object library and get to work!\", <a\nhref=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2012/04/mock-objects-despoil-your-tests.html\">I\nfind mock objects are scalpels, not hammers</a>, in that you need them for only\na few specialized and precise operations, not a tool you'd use every day.</p>\n\n<p>Consider databases.</p>\n\n<p>One of my projects at work is a database-backed B2C web site. The schema is\nunder fairly active development (I deployed a new version of the site with a\nbig change to the schema an hour ago and have at least two more updates this\nweek). I have a version of the live database handy for testing purposes (with\nuser information scrubbed out, or where that's not possible, salted and\nhashed), but I almost never use it. (I only use it when verifying that a\ndeployment will succeed before performing the deployment.)</p>\n\n<p>Instead, I use <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?DBICx::TestDatabase\">DBICx::TestDatabase</a>\nand a hand-selected subset of data for all of the tests. <code>DBICx::TD</code>\ntakes my existing schema and creates a SQLite database in memory (not on the\ndisk at all) and returns a <code>DBIx::Class</code> schema object connected to\nthat database. My initialization code dumps in some fixture data, and then it's\nready to use in all of my tests.</p>\n\n<p>Again, that database is not on disk. This has at least two benefits. First,\nit's a lot faster than a database on disk, because it has to do less IO. Even\nif I'm very careful about wrapping operations in transactions, waiting for data\nto hit a platter is still a lot slower than waiting for data to hit RAM.\nSecond, every process has its own unique database in memory and there's no\ncontention for the disk or a single database file.

You can take a more general\nprinciple from it as well: make it easy to swap components in and out of your\napplication. The schema layer adds business logic to my data storage, but it's\nalso valuable because it presents an interface between a database and my\napplication. Anything polymorphic (or even allomorphic) to that interface\nshould suffice to give me confidence between tests and deployed\napplication.</p>\n\n<p>(Of course the deployed database on disk has to match the schema in memory,\nbut I did mention we have another mechanism to test that.)</p>"

cdb3e124-353e-fcac-0d91-7db31b748079.description	"<p>Today is Alan Turing&#8217;s 100th birthday. I&#8217;ve been thinking about him lately, in particular about a story that demonstrates the perils of working with genius.</p>\n<p>The story goes that, when Turing was working with the Manchester Baby (the first stored program computer ever built. Just) a colleague wrote the first ever assembler which would turn (relatively) human readable assembly language and turn it into the ones and zeroes of machine code that the machine could actually execute. He showed it to Turing, who blew up at him, ranting that using the computer to do &#8216;trivial&#8217; jobs like that were a massive waste of expensive computer time.</p>\n<p>The problem with working with a genius, from the point of view of more ordinary mortals, is that the genius has only a very rough idea of what is actually easy, and what is only easy to them. From today&#8217;s vantage point, when computers are as freely available as they are now, the idea of <em>not</em> letting the computer do the shitwork for you seems utterly ludicrous &#8211; programmer time is more valuable than computer time.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s less obvious is that the same was true in Turing&#8217;s time (when there was precisely one computer) too. It only takes one programmer to make a mistake in translating from assembler to machine code and run a job that, for instance, gets stuck in an infinite loop and you&#8217;ve probably wasted more computer time (and programmer time) than if you&#8217;d just run it through the assembler in the first place. Turing didn&#8217;t see that, because the process of translating from symbols to binary wasn&#8217;t something that he found particularly complicated. To him, what was needed wasn&#8217;t more and better tools, it was more and better Turings.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not entirely sure that I believe the story (and I can&#8217;t remember where I heard it, so it may be a phantom of my memory). It certainly doesn&#8217;t chime with the Turing who was instrumental in mechanising the shitwork of finding the days rotor settings so that Enigma traffic could be cracked. The history of Bletchley Park is a story of building better and better machines to do the dully repetitive jobs that humans find so hard to stick to and which machines excel at.</p>\n<p>The &#8220;Just write code without bugs in the first place&#8221; school of programming is alive and well today. It&#8217;s not my school though. I&#8217;m very much an exploratory coder. I like to have tests to show me the way and to keep me honest so that I don&#8217;t go breaking things when I change this bit here. I&#8217;ve customised my editing environment to help me as much as possible. I have a nasty habit of writing bare words that I should have quoted, so I have a keystroke that shoves the last word into quotes for me. Another keystroke will align all the broad arrows at the current level of nesting. I&#8217;ve got snippets set up that fill in standard boilerplate when I start a new class, a huge list of common spelling mistakes that get autocorrected while I&#8217;m not looking and an expanding list of other little helpers that I need to write when I get around to it. Automation lets me go faster, make more and better mistakes and recover from them faster. I am a of little brain and I want all the help I can give myself.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure that Turing would be in the same camp as me.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the thing though &#8211; Turing was, definitely, a genius. But his paper &#8220;On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem&#8221; (the one that gave the world the Turing Machine) has a bug in it. In fact, it has two. The first is obvious enough that I spotted it when i read the paper for the first time. The second bug is rather more subtle (but still fixable. It&#8217;s okay, the field of computing is not build on sand).</p>\n<p>I love that The Paper &#8211; The one that&#8217;s the theoretical basis for the modern world (first publishd 75 years ago, round(ish) number fans) &#8211; has a bug. It gives me a strange kind of hope. Fallibility gets us all &#8211; even people who have saved the world. I think we should celebrate the humanity as well as the genius. Turing was, by all accounts, a very odd fish, but the world is undeniably richer for his contributions.</p>\n<p>So, let&#8217;s raise a glass to the memory of Alan Turing tonight, marathon runner, gay icon, saviour of the world and the pleasantly fallible inventor of the modern world. Not a bad CV, when you think about it.</p>\n<h4>Updated</h4>\n<p>Apparently I&#8217;m wrong about it being Turing who didn&#8217;t like the assembler but Von Neumann (another genius). See below for details. And phew! How nice to find that a hero doesn&#8217;t have feet of clay.</p>"

It just so happened that <span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span> (Yet Another Perl Conference) was held in Asheville this year, the week before the gathering&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.swangathering.com/Catalog/TS/sgtssched.html\">Traditional Song Week</a>. Well, I&#8217;m a perl hacker. I sing traditional songs. My employer was paying for me to attend <span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span> and were willing for me to extend my stay in America by a week. It was a no brainer really.</p>\n<p><span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span> was bloody good this year. Perl 5 development is moving forward and the community is buzzing because of it. Lots of &#8220;… and we&#8217;re hiring&#8221; slides. And that&#8217;s before we get to the pleasure of catching up with friends that I only see online most of the time. If you&#8217;re working in any field that has grassroots conferences associated with it, I can&#8217;t recommend attending them highly enough.</p>\n<h3>On to Swannanoa</h3>\n<p>At Swannanoa, I met Sheila Kay Adams and immediately switched my schedule to spend as much time singing with her as possible. Sheila&#8217;s a seventh generation ballad singer from the Sodom Laurel community in Madison Count. Her &#8220;grannie Berzil&#8221; Wallin remembered Cecil Sharp coming to Madison County and collecting songs from the family.</p>\n<p>Pedigree in singing shouldn&#8217;t matter, but it turns out it does. Sheila grew up in a community which was changing, but which still had old &#8216;love songs&#8217; as an important part of how it understood the world. Today, not so much. People still relate to the world and understand it through songs, but the songs are more likely to be contemporary. Lyrically, many of the love songs that Sheila and her family sing could have been written yesterday, but their performance is radically different from contemporary style. One voice, unaccompanied, a style that requires the listener to concentrate on the song rather than any aspects of production. Not something you&#8217;re going to dance to at your wedding, say.</p>\n<p>Sheila&#8217;s classes, on Meeting House Songs (more later) and her Ballads class with Bobbie McMillon were just wonderful; I won&#8217;t forget in a hurry the sound Bobbie singing &#8220;A conversation with Death&#8221; as a thunderstorm grumbled across the campus in the background. Spine tingling stuff. Sheila&#8217;s description of how she learned songs &#8220;knee to knee&#8221; has been helpful too. The way it would work was that the teacher and student would be sat out on the porch, often doing some chore or another, and the teacher would sing the first verse of a song. The student would sing it back and the teacher would sing the second verse. The student would then sing the first two verses then the teacher would sing the third verse and the student would sing the first three verses and so on, until the student was singing the whole song back to the teacher. A time consuming process to be sure, but it works.</p>\n<p>I know this because I learned Pretty Saro from a recording of Sheila&#8217;s late husband Jim Taylor, using a variant of the method, &#8220;knee to CD&#8221; if you like. I&#8217;d play the first verse, hit pause and sing it back, play the second verse, pause, repeat the first two… and so on. And in very short order I had the words and tune (up to a point; I listened back to that recording again recently and I&#8217;m singing a different tune now) and could start the process of actually <em>learning</em> the song, which involved singing it it lots, listening to other recordings, singing it some more and then taking the song out and trying it out in front of audiences and listening to what works and what doesn&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve never really finished learning a song; this recording is a snapshot. I hope you enjoy it.</p>"

The references in the second verse are all obvious to me, but I&#8217;m a white middle class English boy who grew up around boats. My childhood reading and yours may not intersect all that much.</p>\n<p>So&#8230;</p>\n<h4>The Walkers and the Blacketts</h4>\n<p>Also known as the <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=intitle:%22Swallows+and+Amazons%22\">Swallows and Amazons.</a> <cite>Swallows and Amazons</cite> is the first &#8216;big&#8217; book that I can remember reading for myself. We were in Cornwall, holidaying at the same place my mum&#8217;s been going to since she was a kid. Mum was reading <cite>Swallows and Amazons</cite> to us, and it was great, but I was impatient to find out what happened next, so I took the book to bed with me and read it for myself. I haven&#8217;t stopped yet. <cite>Swallows and Amazons</cite> was the book that opened my door to reading for pleasure. It opened up a way of looking at the world too. I can&#8217;t imagine who I&#8217;d be if I&#8217;d never read any Ransome.</p>\n<h4>The Pevensies</h4>\n<p>The Pevensies are the family in <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=intitle:%22The+Lion+The+Witch+And+The+Wardrobe%22\">The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe,</a> the first of the Narnia books. I have a slightly troubled relationship with these books now. I <em>really</em> don&#8217;t get on with C. S. Lewis&#8217;s view of the world (I once hurled a taped reading of <cite>The Screwtape Letters</cite> out of the car rather than listen to another word of the bloody things), but I wasn&#8217;t reading between the lines when I was nine. I was just loving the stories and the images they put in my head. And what images&#8230;</p>\n<h4>Simp, the Canine Cannonball</h4>\n<p>What do you mean, you&#8217;ve never read <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=intitle:%22Cannonball+Simp%22\">Cannonball Simp?</a> You poor thing!</p>\n<p><cite>Cannonball Simp</cite>, by John Burningham is <em>the</em> library book for me. Back when I was 4 or 5, I would walk with my dad from Regent&#8217;s Square to the Doncaster Central Library every Saturday morning, with three books clutched under my arm. I&#8217;d hand them over the counter, receiving in exchange 3 buff cardboard library slip holders. I would then go over to the childrens&#8217; books section and pull out three new (to me) books and take them to the counter. The librarian would remove the slip from the library bookplate, place it in one of my surrendered holders and stamp the slip and the bookplate with the date, three weeks hence, by which the book must be renewed.</p>\n<p>Well, that&#8217;s how it worked until weekend I came back with <cite>Cannonball Simp</cite>. I <em>loved</em> it. I didn&#8217;t want to take it back because I hadn&#8217;t learned it yet. Sure I could &#8216;read&#8217; along with Dad &#8211; I knew all the words by then &#8211; but the pictures were another thing entirely. They were <em>beautiful</em>. They still are.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s when I learned of the magic of &#8216;renewal&#8217;. Instead of handing the book back, I showed it to the librarian and said &#8220;I&#8217;d like to renew this, please,&#8221; and instead of giving me my library card back, they just stamped the book and slip with a new date. Wow! It was like I <em>owned</em> the book.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know how many times I renewed that book. I&#8217;m afraid I don&#8217;t remember the words any more. But I still remember the pleasure that it gave me.</p>\n<h4>Galadriel the Fair</h4>\n<p>On the last day of junior school our form teacher, Miss Rees, wrote a long list of books on the board and asked us to copy the list into the back of our exercise books. She said that these were books we should try and read. I don&#8217;t have the exercise book any more and I remember very little of the list. I do remember that I&#8217;d already read some of them. And I remember <cite>The Hobbit</cite> and <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=intitle:%22The+Lord+of+the+Rings%22\">The Lord of the Rings</a>. Oh boy, do I remember <cite>The Hobbit</cite> and <cite>The Lord of the Rings</cite>.</p>\n<p>Terry Pratchett said that if you&#8217;re a 14 year old boy and you don&#8217;t think that The Lord of the Rings is the best book ever written then there may be something wrong with you, but if you&#8217;re 28 and you <em>still</em> think it&#8217;s the best book ever written then there&#8217;s <em>definitely</em> something wrong with you. I <em>was</em> that 14 year old boy. I stayed up all night reading it. I fell asleep reading it. I read the appendices. I worked out how to write my name in Elvish script. I even read <cite>The Silmarillion</cite> and thought I enjoyed it. I can still recite some of the poetry. In Elvish. I&#8217;ve forgotten the words of Cannonball Simp, but get me going with &#8220;A Elbereth Gilthoniel&#8230;&#8221; and I can just about reel off the rest of the poem. What&#8217;s wrong with me?</p>\n<p>By the time I was 28, LotR wasn&#8217;t the best book ever written. I&#8217;m no longer sure that there is such a thing as &#8220;The Best Book Ever Written&#8221;. Still, if you haven&#8217;t at least read <cite>The Hobbit</cite> you should take steps to rectify matters. Or wait for the Peter Jackson movie.</p>\n<h4>The Daughter of a Pirate King</h4>\n<p>Confession time: I haven&#8217;t read <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=intitle:%22Pippi+Longstocking%22\">Pippi Longstocking</a>. The &#8216;I&#8217; of <cite>A Child of the Library</cite> is a composite of Gill and me. <cite>Pippi Longstocking</cite> was her Nancy Blackett. The  <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=Bastable+inauthor:Nesbit\">Bastables</a> were her Pevensies.</p>\n<h4>Paddington the Bear</h4>\n<p>Once I&#8217;d learned that reading for myself was pure pleasure, I read anything and everything I could find in the library and I discovered Michael Bond&#8217;s <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=intitle:Paddington+inauthor:%22Michael+Bond%22\">Paddington Bear</a>. Paddington was a well meaning young bear from Peru who was found, wearing a duffel coat and a label reading &#8220;Please look after this bear&#8221;, at Paddington Station by the Brown Family. The Browns took him in immediately, named him Paddington after the station and&#8230; &#8216;hijinks ensue&#8217;.</p>\n<p>I would be quietly reading these books to myself when some episode or another (&#8220;Baked Elastic&#8221;; the Russian ballet dancer; the wobbly table&#8230;) would cause me to laugh out loud and my brother would demand to know what was funny and made me read whatever it was aloud to him. I have to confess, I resented this, but not enough to dent my enjoyment. The Paddington books are made of joy.</p>"

6641930e-cbbe-3c29-57ae-bcf306c5a40c.description	"<p>Or… what I did this summer.</p>\n<p>Summer as been frantic. Mostly joyous, but frantic.</p>\n<p>I had talks accepted at both <a href=\"http://www.yapc2011.us/yn2011/\"><span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span></a> and <a href=\"http://oscon.com/\"><span class=\"caps\">OSCON</span></a>. Because <span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span> was in Asheville, and the <a href=\"http://www.swangathering.com/\">Swannanoa Gathering</a> Traditional Song Week fell the week after <span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span>, that meant I flew out to Asheville for an intense fortnight of Perl community engagement followed by a week spent singing myself hoarse and being blown away by <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/sheilakayadams\">Sheila Kay Adams&#8217;s</a> singing and her stories of mountain life and listening to future stars like <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/sheilakayadams\">Sam Gleaves</a> and inspiring activists like <a href=\"http://www.blairpathways.com/\">Saro Lynch Thomason</a>. I could write entire posts on every one of those, and that&#8217;s before I get on to the magic of watching the sun go down and the fireflies come up from the grass of the Warren Wilson College&#8217;s natural amphitheatre. Magical so it was.</p>\n<p>On the last night of the gathering, there was a student showcase. Of course, I sang <a href=\"http://www.bofh.org.uk/child-of-the-library\">Child of the Library</a>. Rather embarrassingly, I skipped a verse, but the response was great. Several people came up to me afterwards and told me their library stories and, I hope, went home with a determination to help protect their libraries.</p>\n<p>Then it was back to the UK for a fortnight before heading off again to <span class=\"caps\">OSCON</span> in Portland, OR. I was down to give two talks, one on <a href=\"http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011/public/schedule/detail/17872\">Higher Order Javascript</a> and a second on <a href=\"http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011/public/schedule/detail/18577\">Polymorphic Dispatch</a> which proved to be a bear to write. I&#8217;d planned to have everything done and dusted and the slides learned by the time I flew out, but spent a huge amount of time blocked on how I was going to present the ideas using a motivating problem that hit the sweet spot between too simple and too complicated. It wasn&#8217;t until I arrived in Portland and talked things through with my host, <a href=\"http://www.justatheory.com/\">David Wheeler</a>, that I got that worked out. The slides were written in a tearing rush and weren&#8217;t as good as I would like them to be. I still owe the talk attendees a full writeup, so I&#8217;ll take this opportunity to apologise for the lateness and promise that a writeup <em>will</em> arrive. The Javascript talk was based on one I&#8217;ve given before, but I&#8217;m starting to realise that it&#8217;s a full tutorial masquerading as a short talk. More on that later, I hope.</p>\n<p>What with flapping about the unwritten talk, and the 10 minute gap between them, I didn&#8217;t really worry overmuch about the Perl lightning talks. It&#8217;s been my practice to sing a lightly massaged version of <a href=\"http://LOUANDPETER.COM/\">Lou and Peter Berryman&#8217;s</a> very splendid song <cite>A Chat With Your Mother</cite> with tailored verses about different language communities and various Perl luminaries. I <em>had</em> decided to retire it, but at <span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span> I came up with a snide verse about myself and another about Larry Wall, so it felt renewed enough to be worth singing this year as well. I ended up singing Child of the Library again.</p>\n<p>The response was phenomenal. I&#8217;ve been singing it for long enough now that I know it <em>gets</em> people. Hell, when I was writing it, there were verses that were hard to sing because they got me and I was choking up as I tried to sing them. But the lightning talk got a standing ovation. Again people were telling me library stories and I found that the UK isn&#8217;t the only country with local governments stupid enough to consider closing libraries, it was happening in the US too. So, fired up by that response, I went to see Sarah Novotny and begged her for five minutes on the <span class=\"caps\">OSCON</span> stage before the closing keynote. Bless her, she let me have it.</p>\n<h3>Pics, or it didn&#8217;t happen!</h3>\n<p>I have proof too! The main stage at O&#8217;Reilly events has serious video equipment pointed at it. Because it&#8217;s important that people get to see serious talks about <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnX5v0uwNjc&amp;list=PL93FC98105B19725C&amp;index=39&amp;feature=plpp\">known bugs and exploits in wetware</a>. Because my performance wasn&#8217;t on the schedule, and I didn&#8217;t have a video release all signed and ready to go beforehand, it&#8217;s taken a while to get the video available. But last night, that changed, so here I am, in all my corpulent glory. Enjoy. And please, spread this video as far and as wide as you can. Libraries are important.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"345\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/MDi5JtS1H-g\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>"

16778279-0832-e7cb-09fd-4c85f1bda681.description	"<p>Here&#8217;s a revised version of <a href=\"http://www.bofh.org.uk/2011/02/08/save-our-libraries\"><cite>A Child of the Library</cite></a>.</p>\n<p><object height=\"81\" width=\"100%\"> <param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F13031396\"></param> <param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param> <embed allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"81\" src=\"http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F13031396\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed> </object>  <span><a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/pdcawley/child-of-the-library-revised\">Child Of The Library (Revised)</a> by <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/pdcawley\">pdcawley</a></span></p>\n<p>Whenever I learn a new song, there&#8217;s a period of making it &#8220;mine&#8221;. This happens as I sing  it out to different audiences and find out which bits work, which bits are hard to sing and all the other little details that you only find out when there&#8217;s a living, breathing, listening and (hopefully) singing audience in front of you.</p>\n<p>It turns out that the same things happens with songs I&#8217;ve written.</p>\n<p>The biggest stumbling block of the original version is the last line of the first verse:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My wife met Pippi Langstumpf, I met Paddington the Bear</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Someone on the comment thread suggested:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Heidi, Pippi Longstocking and Paddington the Bear</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which is fine, except that means singing &#8216;PIPpi LONGstockING&#8217;, and I&#8217;m not happy with putting the emphasis on the <span class=\"caps\">WRONG</span> sylLABles if I can possibly help it. In the revised version, I think I&#8217;ve cracked it. The line is now:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The daughter of a pirate king and Paddington the bear</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which is <em>much</em> easier to sing and follows the rest of the verse by being a more oblique reference to the character. If you know who Pippi is, then it&#8217;s obvious who I&#8217;m singing about. If you don&#8217;t, then maybe I&#8217;ve piqued your curiosity.</p>\n<p>The first recording also had two slightly different tunes for the verses, this version has settled on just the one.</p>\n<p>And, for people who care about that sort of thing, this was recorded with a click track at 110bpm rather than speeding up over the course of the song, which should make life a little easier for anyone taking part in Rabid Gravy&#8217;s <a href=\"http://blog.rabidgravy.com/making-music-to-save-our-libraries\">project</a> to remix and rerecord different versions of the song.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re concerned about Library closures, a good place to start is <a href=\"http://www.voicesforthelibrary.org.uk/\">Voices for the Library</a>. If you&#8217;re on twitter, you might also start following <a href=\"http://twitter.com/ukpling\">@ukpling</a>. If you&#8217;re not concerned about library closures, why on earth did you read this far, and what kind of excuse for a human being are you?</p>"

Frankly, instrumentation scares me, I&#8217;m much happier singing unaccompanied but I realise I&#8217;m in a minority on this.</p>\n<p>When you sing it, try making the song your own by changing things to suit your own. Julie Chilton&#8217;s posted an alternate first verse in the comments, but the world is the mollusc of your choice.</p>\n<p>The &#8216;I&#8217; in the song, isn&#8217;t <em>quite</em> me and it isn&#8217;t quite Gill either. Most importantly, both of us grew up in houses where no book was out of bounds. Our fathers used to take us to our respective local libraries (Lewisham for Gill, Doncaster Central and then Bawtry for me) every week or so on a Saturday morning. As soon as I was old enough, I&#8217;d ride my bike from our home in Scrooby to Bawtry with a carrier full of books hanging off the handlebars. Bawtry is currently in the crosshairs of Doncaster&#8217;s idiot mayor &#8211; the bloke who suggested getting kindles for everyone instead &#8211; along with 13 other libraries in the district.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a revised version of the recording with additional notes at: http://www.bofh.org.uk/2011/04/04/a-child-of-the-library-revised, or just press play:</p>\n<p><object height=\"81\" width=\"100%\"> <param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F13031396\"></param> <param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param> <embed allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"81\" src=\"http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F13031396\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed> </object>  <span><a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/pdcawley/child-of-the-library-revised\">Child Of The Library (Revised)</a> by <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/pdcawley\">pdcawley</a></span></p>\n<h5>August 9th 2011</h5>\n<p>I&#8217;ve updated the lyrics here to reflect what I sing now.

33eb4a86-5f1e-a264-617f-f3b5e5c6b9b2.description	"<p>In <a href=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2012/09/features-perl-5-needs-in-2012.html\">Features Perl 5 Needs in 2012</a>, I suggested five mostly-not-syntax features that Perl 5 could use right now.</p>\n\n<p>The caveat to all of these features is that 1) someone must <em>code</em>\nthem and 2) someone must <em>maintain</em> them. While p5p has traditionally\ndone a lot with a little, remember that any suggestions or discussions will\nonly make it into a Perl 5 release if enough effort goes into implementation to\nmake them happen. If you want any of these features to happen, contact TPF\nabout donations or volunteer your time and skills to help (even if all you feel\ncomfortable doing is helping to refine the design of a feature, that's\nworthwhile).</p>\n\n<p>I promised to explain these features in more detail. First up is a\nmetaobject protocol for Perl 5. Stevan Little and Jesse Luehrs are working on\n<a href=\"https://github.com/stevan/p5-mop\">a proof of concept MOP for Perl\n5</a>, so this feature is well underway.</p>\n\n<p>If you're not familiar with a metaobject protocol, the book <a\nhref=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Metaobject-Protocol-Gregor-Kiczales/dp/0262610744?tag=onyneopre-20\">The\nArt of the Metaobject Protocol</a> explains everything in extensive detail.\n(It's also a pretty good book about Common Lisp, so if you're interested in a\nsemi-practical theoretical exploration of why computer sciencey things like the\nlambda calculus and well-designed extension mechanisms matter, this is a great\nbook about the design and implementation of a language.)</p>\n\n<p>If you don't want to read ~350 pages right now, the short definition of a\nMOP is <em>an API for interacting with your object system</em>. Classes (if\nyour MOP supports them) are objects. You can define a new class by making\nmethod calls. You can create objects by making method calls. You can define an\nentirely new <em>style</em> of class by creating your own new metaclass with\ndifferent behaviors. This is the reason <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Class::MOP\">Class::MOP</a> predated <a\nhref=\"http://moose.perl.org/\">Moose</a>.</p>\n\n<p>A good MOP provides a great theoretical foundation for a wonderful object\nsystem. Where many of us have defended Perl 5's object system as \"minimal but\neffective and flexible\", a good MOP in the core would let us get rid of\n<code>bless</code> in our code... and have more good features.</p>\n\n<h2>Performance Improvements</h2>\n\n<p>Moose can be slow to start, if you have lots of little classes, all on disk\nin their individual modules. Not only are you doing lots of IO to find and load\nthose classes, but you have to build up all of the classes you've defined in\nmemory through Moose's import mechanism (<code>has()</code> and\n<code>extends()</code> and <code>with()</code> are all function calls) which\ncreates and populates a metaclass behind the scenes.</p>\n\n<p>This happens every time you start your program.</p>\n\n<p>Every MooseX extension you load changes things.</p>\n\n<p>Though some of this happens in XS, where memory use can be smaller (less\nPerl data structure overhead) and speed can be faster (the same algorithm done\nin C instead of something written atop C), much of this happens at the Perl 5\nlevel.</p>\n\n<p>A great MOP could have its own custom data structures and code in the core\nto represent classes and methods and attributes, rather than Perl 5 hashes and\narrays. A great MOP could have its own ops to handle things like introspection\nand dispatch. A great MOP could have parser support to avoid the overhead of\ncalling Perl 5 functions (or crossing the XS boundary) to perform basic\nsetup.</p>\n\n<h2>Simplicity of Alternate Object Systems</h2>\n\n<p>Perl 5's default object system is very flexible for strange people like me\nwho've programmed in far too many languages (and implemented a few) who like\nvarious features of multiple languages and think \"Hey, I know, I'll implement\nthis in Perl 5.\" You bless a reference. You invoke a method. That's it.\nEverything else you can build yourself.</p>\n\n<p>The downside is that you have to figure out how to build it yourself.\nSometimes that means even diving into the source code of Perl 5 <em>itself</em>\nto see how things happen.</p>\n\n<p>A good MOP provides a foundation on which you can provide your own custom\nbehavior. As long as you hew to the protocol it defines, you can do anything\nyou want: make a custom metaclass that allows simple and protected shared\nmemory between workers, provide automatic auditing around specific methods,\nproxy transparently to remote resources, anything.</p>\n\n<p>Better yet...</p>\n\n<h2>Interoperability Between Different Object Systems</h2>\n\n<p>One of the projects I maintain uses Moose heavily. One of its dependencies\npulls in <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Moo\">Moo</a>. The authors of\nboth object systems have gone to great lengths to make sure that both work\ntogether.</p>\n\n<p>With a good MOP in place in the core, you have to go to great lengths\n<em>not to interoperate well with other object systems</em>. The default is\ninteroperability.</p>\n\n<p>(Try that in Perl 5 now, where some of the web programming or IO classes\nbless typeglobs. Oh, you expected a blessed hash? Too bad!)</p>\n\n<h2>Syntactic Improvements</h2>\n\n<p>As I alluded to earlier, a good MOP opens the door for declarative syntaxes\nfor defining classes, methods, and attributes. We might finally get a\n<code>class</code> keyword and a <code>method</code> keyword. This is very nice\nbecause it'll be faster, but also...</p>\n\n<h2>Tool Improvements</h2>\n\n<p>... language keywords the language itself knows make their way into syntax\nhighlighters and static analysis tools and reformatters and refactorers. It's\neasy to get a list of all of the methods in all of the classes in a file when\nit's unambiguous to pick out all of the names of classes in a file because you\n<em>know</em> they all have the <code>class</code> keyword in front of them,\nfor example.</p>\n\n<p>Compare that to today, where anything that looks like a coderef in a\nnamespace is potentially a method or potentially a function and the only way to\nknow is to invoke it, and why bother even trying?</p>\n\n<h2>Current Status</h2>\n\n<p>It's difficult to argue against putting a MOP in the core. Stevan and Jesse\nare working hard on it, but they could use more eyeballs on the tests and\ndesign and certainly more testing on various platforms. If you've been looking\nfor an excuse to contribute to Perl 5.18 or Perl 5.20, this is a great place to\nstart.</p>"

61e9f203-0d4d-2bbd-0154-4a46c0258f97.description	"<p>I haven't written an infinite loop bug in a while. I suppose I was due. (The Greek gods always punish hubris.)</p>\n\n<p>I have a database table full of users. Let's call that table\n<code>user</code>. A user has one or more roles (from the <code>role</code>)\ntable. A user can be an unverified user, a free user, a subscriber, or an\nadministrator. (Administrators obviously are also subscribers, but you get the\npoint.)</p>\n\n<p>I use <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?DBIx::Class\">DBIx::Class</a>\nfor the database access layer. My <code>User</code> result class has a couple\nof methods which let other model actions query whether the user can perform\nspecific operations. They're <a\nhref=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2011/05/decoupling-testability-and-synthetic-attributes.html\">synthetic\nattributes</a>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>has [<span class=\"Constant\">qw(</span><span class=\"Constant\"> is_admin is_subscriber </span><span class=\"Constant\">)</span>], <span class=\"Constant\">is</span> =&gt; <span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">ro</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span>, <span class=\"Constant\">lazy_build</span> =&gt; <span class=\"Constant\">1</span>;\n\n<span class=\"Statement\">sub </span><span class=\"Identifier\">_build_is_admin      </span>{ <span class=\"Statement\">shift</span>-&gt;find_role_by_name( <span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">admin</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span>      ) }\n<span class=\"Statement\">sub </span><span class=\"Identifier\">_build_is_subscriber </span>{ <span class=\"Statement\">shift</span>-&gt;find_role_by_name( <span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">subscriber</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span> ) }</code></pre>\n\n<p>Obviously the implementation of <code>find_role_by_name()</code> is\nsupremely important. Here's how I originally wrote the code (no sense blaming\nanyone else for this, because <em>I</em> wrote all of the access control code\nmyself.) See if you can catch the bug:</p>\n\n<pre><code><span class=\"Statement\">sub </span><span class=\"Identifier\">find_role_by_name</span>\n{\n    <span class=\"Statement\">my</span> (<span class=\"Identifier\">$self</span>, <span class=\"Identifier\">$name</span>) = <span class=\"Identifier\">@_</span>;\n\n    <span class=\"Statement\">while</span> (<span class=\"Statement\">my</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$role</span> = <span class=\"Identifier\">$self</span><span class=\"Identifier\">-&gt;user_roles-&gt;next</span>)\n    {\n        <span class=\"Statement\">return</span> <span class=\"Constant\">1</span> <span class=\"Statement\">if</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$role</span><span class=\"Identifier\">-&gt;role-&gt;name</span> <span class=\"Statement\">eq</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$name</span>;\n    }\n\n    <span class=\"Statement\">return</span> <span class=\"Constant\">0</span>;\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>As a hint, the <code>user_roles</code> method represents the relationship\nbetween the <code>user</code> table and the <code>role</code> table. That\nmethod returns a DBIC resultset which represents the entries in the table with\na foreign key to the <code>user</code> table.</p>\n\n<p>See the bug yet? It took me a while. The problem is that <em>every\ninvocation of the loop</em> fetches a new resultset. Every invocation of the\nloop fetches only the <em>first</em> result from that resultset.</p>\n\n<p>My tests (yeah, I wrote the tests too, before I wrote this code in fact,\njust like you're supposed to do) didn't catch that because the rest of the code\nonly ever checked for one user role, the administrator role, anywhere else.\nOnly when I added code for the subscriber role did the subscription tests\ntrigger this infinite loop. (Now how abhorred in my imagination is that most\nexcellent jest!)</p>\n\n<p>I wish I could say that I diagnosed the cause immediately. I didn't. I\nstared at the code for far too long, until I had the presence of mind to put a\ndebugging statement in the loop body to print the name of the role.  (Stat\nofficium pristina nomine.)</p>\n\n<p>Here's the corrected code, with a single expression hoisted into a scalar\nvariable where it may endure properly:</p>\n\n<pre><code><span class=\"Statement\">sub </span><span class=\"Identifier\">find_role_by_name</span>\n{\n    <span class=\"Statement\">my</span> (<span class=\"Identifier\">$self</span>, <span class=\"Identifier\">$name</span>) = <span class=\"Identifier\">@_</span>;\n    <span class=\"Statement\">my</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$user_roles_rs</span> = <span class=\"Identifier\">$self</span><span class=\"Identifier\">-&gt;user_roles</span>;\n\n    <span class=\"Statement\">while</span> (<span class=\"Statement\">my</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$role</span> = <span class=\"Identifier\">$user_roles_rs</span><span class=\"Identifier\">-&gt;next</span>)\n    {\n        <span class=\"Statement\">return</span> <span class=\"Constant\">1</span> <span class=\"Statement\">if</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$role</span><span class=\"Identifier\">-&gt;role-&gt;name</span> <span class=\"Statement\">eq</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$name</span>;\n    }\n\n    <span class=\"Statement\">return</span> <span class=\"Constant\">0</span>;\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>I will say this: expecting your test suite to pass in under 30 seconds makes this sort of thing much easier to catch. If I'd had to wait for a continuous integration server to get around to checking this commit, I wouldn't have fixed it as quickly as I did.</p>\n\n<p>Then again, it's easier to debug bugs you never write in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>Oh, and if you catch the literary allusion in the title, here's your prize:\ncongratulations! You might be overeducated. (If you caught the other three\nallusions, have you ever noticed how much Pynchon's <em>V</em> influenced\nStephenson's <em>Cryptonomicon</em>?)</p>"

Consider\ntypical Moose code:</p>\n\n<pre><code><span class=\"Statement\">package</span><span class=\"Type\"> MyApp::App::Role::HasMailer</span>;\n<span class=\"Comment\"># ABSTRACT: role which provides other app roles with a mailer</span>\n\n<span class=\"Statement\">use </span>Modern::Perl;\n<span class=\"Statement\">use </span>Moose::Role;\n\n<span class=\"Statement\">use </span>MyApp::Mailer;\n\nhas <span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">mailer</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span>, <span class=\"Constant\">is</span> =&gt; <span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">ro</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span>, <span class=\"Constant\">lazy_build</span> =&gt; <span class=\"Constant\">1</span>;\n\n<span class=\"Statement\">sub </span><span class=\"Identifier\">_build_mailer</span>\n{\n    <span class=\"Statement\">my</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$self</span>        = <span class=\"Statement\">shift</span>;\n    <span class=\"Statement\">my</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$config</span>      = <span class=\"Statement\">do</span> <span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">myapp_local.pl</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span>;\n    <span class=\"Statement\">my</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$mail_client</span> = <span class=\"Identifier\">$config-&gt;{</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">Model::UserMail</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Identifier\">}</span><span class=\"Identifier\">{</span><span class=\"Constant\">mail_client</span><span class=\"Identifier\">}</span>;\n    <span class=\"Statement\">return</span> MyApp::Mailer-&gt;new( <span class=\"Identifier\">$mail_client</span> );\n}\n\n<span class=\"Constant\">1</span>;</code></pre>\n\n<p>... where functions such as <code>has</code> and <code>with</code> and\n<code>extends</code> look like declarations (such as <code>my</code> and\n<code>sub</code>), but are actually code to run.</p>\n\n<p>The difference is important. A declaration that's part of the language's\ngrammar need only be <em>parsed</em> to have its effects take place, while a\nstatement or expression needs to <em>run</em> to take place.</p>\n\n<p>This is, of course, why variable declarations makes lexical scoping trivial\nto understand for experienced Perl programmers, why binding closures to their\nlexical environments is easy in the simple cases, and why binding closures to\ntheir lexical environments when you use the STRING form of <code>eval</code> is\nso difficult.</p>\n\n<p>As Moose hackers will tell you, Moose isn't a simple preprocessor you run\nover your code once to generate <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Moose::Manual::Unsweetened\">longer, uglier\ncode without syntactic goodness</a>. Instead, <a\nhref=\"http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=685459\">classes are built, not\ndeclared</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This is endemic to Moose, but it's not a characteristic specific to Modern\nPerl. It's inherent in Perl 5 itself, even the 1994 version. <a\nhref=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2009/08/how-a-perl-5-program-works.html\">Perl\n5 lets you run arbitrary code while parsing happens</a>.</p>\n\n<p>While you can gain tremendous flexibility with this approach (building up\nclosures with partially applied arguments to export to caller namespaces), you\ncan't serialize the resulting code as easily because you may have to run\narbitrary code to restore your program in memory.</p>\n\n<p>Put another way, <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Exporter\">Exporter</a> is a library while\nit should be core language behavior.</p>\n\n<p>In the simple case where a library wants to export a couple of symbols into\nthe caller's namespace, say <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> from <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?List::Util\">List::Util</a>, why is there\nno simple syntax for marking those symbols as exportable in\n<code>List::Util</code> without having to run code (or worse yet, <em>inherit\nfrom</em>) <code>Exporter</code>?</p>\n\n<p>If a declarative syntax existed&mdash;with language support or at least the\nbroad consistency to allow for tool support&mdash;such that it were statically\npossible to determine the symbols exported from one package and imported into\nanother package, precompilation would be easier. A module could have a static\nlist of exports provided in a manifest of sorts. (A good optimizer could even\ndecline to import unused code!)</p>\n\n<p>I realize it isn't always possible to reduce all cases of exporting to a\nlist of static symbols (nor is it desirable to remove that power), but at least\n80% of the code I write would benefit from this. We'd also be able to have\nbetter tool support for the language; it would be easier to discover which\nsymbols come from where, and we might even close the \"You can't always tell\nwhich of two interpretations of a parse tree is valid in Perl 5 code thanks to\n<code>import</code> and <code>BEGIN</code>\" gap a little further.</p>\n\n<p>(... but then someone will ask why <code>strict</code> is a pragma and not\ncore language behavior, especially after looking at its implementation, and\nthen we'll all go to the paint store to pick out our favorite colors. See also \"I didn't provide an example of this declarative syntax, so you can't argue about it in the comments.\")</p>"

a772547e-c6ed-788b-01c5-4c92a13892f9.description	"<p>One of my work projects has a test suite that's grown a little too slow for\nmy liking. With only a few hundred tests, I've seen our test runs take over 30\nseconds in a couple of cases. We're diligent about separating tests into\nindividual logical files, so that when we work on a feature we can run only its\ntests as we develop and save running the whole suite for the last verification\nbefore checkin, but 30 seconds is still too long.</p>\n\n<p>(Before you ask, <a\nhref=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2011/11/parallelism-and-test-suites.html\">our\ntest suite is fully parallelizable</a>, so that 30 seconds keeps all of the\ncores on a development box at full usage.)</p>\n\n<p>I realize that one fad in software of the last few years is continuous\nintegration, where you submit your commits to a box somewhere for that to run\nthe full test suite and email you if something goes wrong, sometime in the\nfuture, hopefully less than an hour from now. Hopefully.</p>\n\n<p>We can't afford to wait that long to know if our code is right. (I like to\npush to our production box as soon as we have well-tested fixes that we know\nwork reliably. That's often more than once per day. I'm the only one working on\nthe site today, and I've already pushed three changes, with at least one more\ncoming.)</p>\n\n<p>When I worked on <a href=\"http://parrotcode.org/\">Parrot</a>, I spent a lot\nof time profiling the VM to sneak out small performance improvements here and\nthere, using less memory and far fewer CPU cycles. I'm at home in a profiler,\nso I picked a very small test program and ran it through <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Devel::NYTProf\">Devel::NYTProf</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I've mentioned before that this application has a <a\nhref=\"http://catalystframework.org/\">Catalyst</a> frontend which takes full\nadvantage of <a href=\"http://moose.perl.org/\">Moose</a> throughout. It uses <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?DBIx::Class\">DBIx::Class</a> as its\npersistence layer.</p>\n\n<p>As you might expect, <em>startup</em> time dominates most of the tests. We\nhave 21 individual test files, and startup took close to two seconds for each\nof them. No matter how much we parallelized, we were always going to spend no\nless than 40 total seconds running tests. (The non-parallel test suite runs in\n~67 seconds, so parallelization already gives a 55% improvement.)</p>\n\n<p>When I looked at the profile, I saw that most of the startup time came from\na couple of dependencies we didn't need.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, even though I use <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?HTML::FormHandler\">HTML::FormHandler</a>\nquite happily on another project, we don't use it on this project at all. We\ndid use a Catalyst plugin which brought it in as a dependency, but we never\nused that feature.</p>\n\n<p>I spent an hour revising that part of our application to remove that plugin\n(which we used to use, then customized our code so that the plugin was almost\nvestigial) and the parallel test run went down to 23 seconds.</p>\n\n<p>We trimmed 10% of our dependencies, just by removing one plugin and the code\nit brought in.</p>\n\n<p>(Tip: use <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Devel::TraceUse\">Devel::TraceUse</a> to\nfind out which modules load which modules. It's a good way to get the\nconceptual weight of a dependency.)</p>\n\n<p>I don't shy away from dependencies when they're useful, but I ended up\nrevising one file and ending up with <em>less</em> code overall than we had\nbefore I started.</p>\n\n<p>With that said, there's clearly room for improvement. I traced through some\nMoose code which handles initialization (especially of attributes) and it seems\nlike there should be some efficiency gains there. Similarly, both Catalyst and\nDBIC go through some contortions to load plugins and components that in my case\nwere unnecessary. (I have a patch to consider for the former, but not the\nlatter.)</p>\n\n<p>Two things I learned do bother me somewhat. If you use\n<code>Devel::TraceUse</code> on a project of any size, you'll see a lot of\ninconsistency and duplication, thanks to years of TIMTOWTDI. Catalyst brings in\nMoose, but DBIC eventually ends up bringing in <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Moo\">Moo</a>. No one can decide whether to\nuse <code>@ISA</code> or <code>use base '...';</code> or <code>use parent\n'...';</code>. A lot of larger projects (DateTime, Moose extensions) have lots\nof helper modules spread out in lots of tiny <em>.pm</em> files which each need\nto be located, loaded, and compiled.</p>\n\n<p>Worse, all of the nice declarative syntax you get with some of these modern\nlibraries has a cost behind the scenes every time you run the program <em>even\nif nothing has changed</em>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=990666\">If I were to pick an\noptimization target for future versions of Perl 5</a>, I'd want a good way for\nMoose or Catalyst or whatever to precompile my nice sugared code into a cached\nrepresentation that could then load faster on subsequent invocations. (I know\nyou're not getting an order of magnitude improvement here: you still have to\nset up stubs for metaclasses and the like, but even getting attributes and\nmethods in place would be an improvement!)</p>\n\n<p>I'd settle today for a preforking test suite that doesn't require me to\nrewrite all of my tests.</p>\n\n<p>Then again, that ~25% improvement in test execution from removing one\ndependency isn't bad for the week either.</p>"

8716263a-4c95-4bfb-f515-883c54a2d9b3.description	"<p>Today is Alan Turing&#8217;s 100th birthday. I&#8217;ve been thinking about him lately, in particular about a story that demonstrates the perils of working with genius.</p>\n<p>The story goes that, when Turing was working with the Manchester Baby (the first stored program computer ever built. Just) a colleague wrote the first ever assembler which would turn (relatively) human readable assembly language and turn it into the ones and zeroes of machine code that the machine could actually execute. He showed it to Turing, who blew up at him, ranting that using the computer to do &#8216;trivial&#8217; jobs like that were a massive waste of expensive computer time.</p>\n<p>The problem with working with a genius, from the point of view of more ordinary mortals, is that the genius has only a very rough idea of what is actually easy, and what is only easy to them. From today&#8217;s vantage point, when computers are as freely available as they are now, the idea of <em>not</em> letting the computer do the shitwork for you seems utterly ludicrous &#8211; programmer time is more valuable than computer time.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s less obvious is that the same was true in Turing&#8217;s time (when there was precisely one computer) too. It only takes one programmer to make a mistake in translating from assembler to machine code and run a job that, for instance, gets stuck in an infinite loop and you&#8217;ve probably wasted more computer time (and programmer time) than if you&#8217;d just run it through the assembler in the first place. Turing didn&#8217;t see that, because the process of translating from symbols to binary wasn&#8217;t something that he found particularly complicated. To him, what was needed wasn&#8217;t more and better tools, it was more and better Turings.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not entirely sure that I believe the story (and I can&#8217;t remember where I heard it, so it may be a phantom of my memory). It certainly doesn&#8217;t chime with the Turing who was instrumental in mechanising the shitwork of finding the days rotor settings so that Enigma traffic could be cracked. The history of Bletchley Park is a story of building better and better machines to do the dully repetitive jobs that humans find so hard to stick to and which machines excel at.</p>\n<p>The &#8220;Just write code without bugs in the first place&#8221; school of programming is alive and well today. It&#8217;s not my school though. I&#8217;m very much an exploratory coder. I like to have tests to show me the way and to keep me honest so that I don&#8217;t go breaking things when I change this bit here. I&#8217;ve customised my editing environment to help me as much as possible. I have a nasty habit of writing bare words that I should have quoted, so I have a keystroke that shoves the last word into quotes for me. Another keystroke will align all the broad arrows at the current level of nesting. I&#8217;ve got snippets set up that fill in standard boilerplate when I start a new class, a huge list of common spelling mistakes that get autocorrected while I&#8217;m not looking and an expanding list of other little helpers that I need to write when I get around to it. Automation lets me go faster, make more and better mistakes and recover from them faster. I am a of little brain and I want all the help I can give myself.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure that Turing would be in the same camp as me.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the thing though &#8211; Turing was, definitely, a genius. But his paper &#8220;On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem&#8221; (the one that gave the world the Turing Machine) has a bug in it. In fact, it has two. The first is obvious enough that I spotted it when i read the paper for the first time. The second bug is rather more subtle (but still fixable. It&#8217;s okay, the field of computing is not build on sand).</p>\n<p>I love that The Paper &#8211; The one that&#8217;s the theoretical basis for the modern world (first publishd 75 years ago, round(ish) number fans) &#8211; has a bug. It gives me a strange kind of hope. Fallibility gets us all &#8211; even people who have saved the world. I think we should celebrate the humanity as well as the genius. Turing was, by all accounts, a very odd fish, but the world is undeniably richer for his contributions.</p>\n<p>So, let&#8217;s raise a glass to the memory of Alan Turing tonight, marathon runner, gay icon, saviour of the world and the pleasantly fallible inventor of the modern world. Not a bad CV, when you think about it.</p>\n<h4>Updated</h4>\n<p>Apparently I&#8217;m wrong about it being Turing who didn&#8217;t like the assembler but Von Neumann (another genius). See below for details. And phew! How nice to find that a hero doesn&#8217;t have feet of clay.</p>"

It just so happened that <span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span> (Yet Another Perl Conference) was held in Asheville this year, the week before the gathering&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.swangathering.com/Catalog/TS/sgtssched.html\">Traditional Song Week</a>. Well, I&#8217;m a perl hacker. I sing traditional songs. My employer was paying for me to attend <span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span> and were willing for me to extend my stay in America by a week. It was a no brainer really.</p>\n<p><span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span> was bloody good this year. Perl 5 development is moving forward and the community is buzzing because of it. Lots of &#8220;… and we&#8217;re hiring&#8221; slides. And that&#8217;s before we get to the pleasure of catching up with friends that I only see online most of the time. If you&#8217;re working in any field that has grassroots conferences associated with it, I can&#8217;t recommend attending them highly enough.</p>\n<h3>On to Swannanoa</h3>\n<p>At Swannanoa, I met Sheila Kay Adams and immediately switched my schedule to spend as much time singing with her as possible. Sheila&#8217;s a seventh generation ballad singer from the Sodom Laurel community in Madison Count. Her &#8220;grannie Berzil&#8221; Wallin remembered Cecil Sharp coming to Madison County and collecting songs from the family.</p>\n<p>Pedigree in singing shouldn&#8217;t matter, but it turns out it does. Sheila grew up in a community which was changing, but which still had old &#8216;love songs&#8217; as an important part of how it understood the world. Today, not so much. People still relate to the world and understand it through songs, but the songs are more likely to be contemporary. Lyrically, many of the love songs that Sheila and her family sing could have been written yesterday, but their performance is radically different from contemporary style. One voice, unaccompanied, a style that requires the listener to concentrate on the song rather than any aspects of production. Not something you&#8217;re going to dance to at your wedding, say.</p>\n<p>Sheila&#8217;s classes, on Meeting House Songs (more later) and her Ballads class with Bobbie McMillon were just wonderful; I won&#8217;t forget in a hurry the sound Bobbie singing &#8220;A conversation with Death&#8221; as a thunderstorm grumbled across the campus in the background. Spine tingling stuff. Sheila&#8217;s description of how she learned songs &#8220;knee to knee&#8221; has been helpful too. The way it would work was that the teacher and student would be sat out on the porch, often doing some chore or another, and the teacher would sing the first verse of a song. The student would sing it back and the teacher would sing the second verse. The student would then sing the first two verses then the teacher would sing the third verse and the student would sing the first three verses and so on, until the student was singing the whole song back to the teacher. A time consuming process to be sure, but it works.</p>\n<p>I know this because I learned Pretty Saro from a recording of Sheila&#8217;s late husband Jim Taylor, using a variant of the method, &#8220;knee to CD&#8221; if you like. I&#8217;d play the first verse, hit pause and sing it back, play the second verse, pause, repeat the first two… and so on. And in very short order I had the words and tune (up to a point; I listened back to that recording again recently and I&#8217;m singing a different tune now) and could start the process of actually <em>learning</em> the song, which involved singing it it lots, listening to other recordings, singing it some more and then taking the song out and trying it out in front of audiences and listening to what works and what doesn&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve never really finished learning a song; this recording is a snapshot. I hope you enjoy it.</p>"

14a8ce3c-6de5-7fad-87be-b2c111d7719d.description	"<p>I sometimes think that I should have published the lyrics to <a href=\"http://www.bofh.org.uk/child-of-the-library\">Child of the Library</a> with a bibliography. The references in the second verse are all obvious to me, but I&#8217;m a white middle class English boy who grew up around boats. My childhood reading and yours may not intersect all that much.</p>\n<p>So&#8230;</p>\n<h4>The Walkers and the Blacketts</h4>\n<p>Also known as the <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=intitle:%22Swallows+and+Amazons%22\">Swallows and Amazons.</a> <cite>Swallows and Amazons</cite> is the first &#8216;big&#8217; book that I can remember reading for myself. We were in Cornwall, holidaying at the same place my mum&#8217;s been going to since she was a kid. Mum was reading <cite>Swallows and Amazons</cite> to us, and it was great, but I was impatient to find out what happened next, so I took the book to bed with me and read it for myself. I haven&#8217;t stopped yet. <cite>Swallows and Amazons</cite> was the book that opened my door to reading for pleasure. It opened up a way of looking at the world too. I can&#8217;t imagine who I&#8217;d be if I&#8217;d never read any Ransome.</p>\n<h4>The Pevensies</h4>\n<p>The Pevensies are the family in <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=intitle:%22The+Lion+The+Witch+And+The+Wardrobe%22\">The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe,</a> the first of the Narnia books. I have a slightly troubled relationship with these books now. I <em>really</em> don&#8217;t get on with C. S. Lewis&#8217;s view of the world (I once hurled a taped reading of <cite>The Screwtape Letters</cite> out of the car rather than listen to another word of the bloody things), but I wasn&#8217;t reading between the lines when I was nine. I was just loving the stories and the images they put in my head. And what images&#8230;</p>\n<h4>Simp, the Canine Cannonball</h4>\n<p>What do you mean, you&#8217;ve never read <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=intitle:%22Cannonball+Simp%22\">Cannonball Simp?</a> You poor thing!</p>\n<p><cite>Cannonball Simp</cite>, by John Burningham is <em>the</em> library book for me. Back when I was 4 or 5, I would walk with my dad from Regent&#8217;s Square to the Doncaster Central Library every Saturday morning, with three books clutched under my arm. I&#8217;d hand them over the counter, receiving in exchange 3 buff cardboard library slip holders. I would then go over to the childrens&#8217; books section and pull out three new (to me) books and take them to the counter. The librarian would remove the slip from the library bookplate, place it in one of my surrendered holders and stamp the slip and the bookplate with the date, three weeks hence, by which the book must be renewed.</p>\n<p>Well, that&#8217;s how it worked until weekend I came back with <cite>Cannonball Simp</cite>. I <em>loved</em> it. I didn&#8217;t want to take it back because I hadn&#8217;t learned it yet. Sure I could &#8216;read&#8217; along with Dad &#8211; I knew all the words by then &#8211; but the pictures were another thing entirely. They were <em>beautiful</em>. They still are.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s when I learned of the magic of &#8216;renewal&#8217;. Instead of handing the book back, I showed it to the librarian and said &#8220;I&#8217;d like to renew this, please,&#8221; and instead of giving me my library card back, they just stamped the book and slip with a new date. Wow! It was like I <em>owned</em> the book.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know how many times I renewed that book. I&#8217;m afraid I don&#8217;t remember the words any more. But I still remember the pleasure that it gave me.</p>\n<h4>Galadriel the Fair</h4>\n<p>On the last day of junior school our form teacher, Miss Rees, wrote a long list of books on the board and asked us to copy the list into the back of our exercise books. She said that these were books we should try and read. I don&#8217;t have the exercise book any more and I remember very little of the list. I do remember that I&#8217;d already read some of them. And I remember <cite>The Hobbit</cite> and <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=intitle:%22The+Lord+of+the+Rings%22\">The Lord of the Rings</a>. Oh boy, do I remember <cite>The Hobbit</cite> and <cite>The Lord of the Rings</cite>.</p>\n<p>Terry Pratchett said that if you&#8217;re a 14 year old boy and you don&#8217;t think that The Lord of the Rings is the best book ever written then there may be something wrong with you, but if you&#8217;re 28 and you <em>still</em> think it&#8217;s the best book ever written then there&#8217;s <em>definitely</em> something wrong with you. I <em>was</em> that 14 year old boy. I stayed up all night reading it. I fell asleep reading it. I read the appendices. I worked out how to write my name in Elvish script. I even read <cite>The Silmarillion</cite> and thought I enjoyed it. I can still recite some of the poetry. In Elvish. I&#8217;ve forgotten the words of Cannonball Simp, but get me going with &#8220;A Elbereth Gilthoniel&#8230;&#8221; and I can just about reel off the rest of the poem. What&#8217;s wrong with me?</p>\n<p>By the time I was 28, LotR wasn&#8217;t the best book ever written. I&#8217;m no longer sure that there is such a thing as &#8220;The Best Book Ever Written&#8221;. Still, if you haven&#8217;t at least read <cite>The Hobbit</cite> you should take steps to rectify matters. Or wait for the Peter Jackson movie.</p>\n<h4>The Daughter of a Pirate King</h4>\n<p>Confession time: I haven&#8217;t read <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=intitle:%22Pippi+Longstocking%22\">Pippi Longstocking</a>. The &#8216;I&#8217; of <cite>A Child of the Library</cite> is a composite of Gill and me. <cite>Pippi Longstocking</cite> was her Nancy Blackett. The  <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=Bastable+inauthor:Nesbit\">Bastables</a> were her Pevensies.</p>\n<h4>Paddington the Bear</h4>\n<p>Once I&#8217;d learned that reading for myself was pure pleasure, I read anything and everything I could find in the library and I discovered Michael Bond&#8217;s <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=intitle:Paddington+inauthor:%22Michael+Bond%22\">Paddington Bear</a>. Paddington was a well meaning young bear from Peru who was found, wearing a duffel coat and a label reading &#8220;Please look after this bear&#8221;, at Paddington Station by the Brown Family. The Browns took him in immediately, named him Paddington after the station and&#8230; &#8216;hijinks ensue&#8217;.</p>\n<p>I would be quietly reading these books to myself when some episode or another (&#8220;Baked Elastic&#8221;; the Russian ballet dancer; the wobbly table&#8230;) would cause me to laugh out loud and my brother would demand to know what was funny and made me read whatever it was aloud to him. I have to confess, I resented this, but not enough to dent my enjoyment. The Paddington books are made of joy.</p>"

5c77a266-a824-f3db-031d-832b157fbe67.description	"<p>Or… what I did this summer.</p>\n<p>Summer as been frantic. Mostly joyous, but frantic.</p>\n<p>I had talks accepted at both <a href=\"http://www.yapc2011.us/yn2011/\"><span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span></a> and <a href=\"http://oscon.com/\"><span class=\"caps\">OSCON</span></a>. Because <span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span> was in Asheville, and the <a href=\"http://www.swangathering.com/\">Swannanoa Gathering</a> Traditional Song Week fell the week after <span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span>, that meant I flew out to Asheville for an intense fortnight of Perl community engagement followed by a week spent singing myself hoarse and being blown away by <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/sheilakayadams\">Sheila Kay Adams&#8217;s</a> singing and her stories of mountain life and listening to future stars like <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/sheilakayadams\">Sam Gleaves</a> and inspiring activists like <a href=\"http://www.blairpathways.com/\">Saro Lynch Thomason</a>. I could write entire posts on every one of those, and that&#8217;s before I get on to the magic of watching the sun go down and the fireflies come up from the grass of the Warren Wilson College&#8217;s natural amphitheatre. Magical so it was.</p>\n<p>On the last night of the gathering, there was a student showcase. Of course, I sang <a href=\"http://www.bofh.org.uk/child-of-the-library\">Child of the Library</a>. Rather embarrassingly, I skipped a verse, but the response was great. Several people came up to me afterwards and told me their library stories and, I hope, went home with a determination to help protect their libraries.</p>\n<p>Then it was back to the UK for a fortnight before heading off again to <span class=\"caps\">OSCON</span> in Portland, OR. I was down to give two talks, one on <a href=\"http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011/public/schedule/detail/17872\">Higher Order Javascript</a> and a second on <a href=\"http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011/public/schedule/detail/18577\">Polymorphic Dispatch</a> which proved to be a bear to write. I&#8217;d planned to have everything done and dusted and the slides learned by the time I flew out, but spent a huge amount of time blocked on how I was going to present the ideas using a motivating problem that hit the sweet spot between too simple and too complicated. It wasn&#8217;t until I arrived in Portland and talked things through with my host, <a href=\"http://www.justatheory.com/\">David Wheeler</a>, that I got that worked out. The slides were written in a tearing rush and weren&#8217;t as good as I would like them to be. I still owe the talk attendees a full writeup, so I&#8217;ll take this opportunity to apologise for the lateness and promise that a writeup <em>will</em> arrive. The Javascript talk was based on one I&#8217;ve given before, but I&#8217;m starting to realise that it&#8217;s a full tutorial masquerading as a short talk. More on that later, I hope.</p>\n<p>What with flapping about the unwritten talk, and the 10 minute gap between them, I didn&#8217;t really worry overmuch about the Perl lightning talks. It&#8217;s been my practice to sing a lightly massaged version of <a href=\"http://LOUANDPETER.COM/\">Lou and Peter Berryman&#8217;s</a> very splendid song <cite>A Chat With Your Mother</cite> with tailored verses about different language communities and various Perl luminaries. I <em>had</em> decided to retire it, but at <span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span> I came up with a snide verse about myself and another about Larry Wall, so it felt renewed enough to be worth singing this year as well. I ended up singing Child of the Library again.</p>\n<p>The response was phenomenal. I&#8217;ve been singing it for long enough now that I know it <em>gets</em> people. Hell, when I was writing it, there were verses that were hard to sing because they got me and I was choking up as I tried to sing them. But the lightning talk got a standing ovation. Again people were telling me library stories and I found that the UK isn&#8217;t the only country with local governments stupid enough to consider closing libraries, it was happening in the US too. So, fired up by that response, I went to see Sarah Novotny and begged her for five minutes on the <span class=\"caps\">OSCON</span> stage before the closing keynote. Bless her, she let me have it.</p>\n<h3>Pics, or it didn&#8217;t happen!</h3>\n<p>I have proof too! The main stage at O&#8217;Reilly events has serious video equipment pointed at it. Because it&#8217;s important that people get to see serious talks about <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnX5v0uwNjc&amp;list=PL93FC98105B19725C&amp;index=39&amp;feature=plpp\">known bugs and exploits in wetware</a>. Because my performance wasn&#8217;t on the schedule, and I didn&#8217;t have a video release all signed and ready to go beforehand, it&#8217;s taken a while to get the video available. But last night, that changed, so here I am, in all my corpulent glory. Enjoy. And please, spread this video as far and as wide as you can. Libraries are important.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"345\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/MDi5JtS1H-g\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>"

This happens as I sing  it out to different audiences and find out which bits work, which bits are hard to sing and all the other little details that you only find out when there&#8217;s a living, breathing, listening and (hopefully) singing audience in front of you.</p>\n<p>It turns out that the same things happens with songs I&#8217;ve written.</p>\n<p>The biggest stumbling block of the original version is the last line of the first verse:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My wife met Pippi Langstumpf, I met Paddington the Bear</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Someone on the comment thread suggested:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Heidi, Pippi Longstocking and Paddington the Bear</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which is fine, except that means singing &#8216;PIPpi LONGstockING&#8217;, and I&#8217;m not happy with putting the emphasis on the <span class=\"caps\">WRONG</span> sylLABles if I can possibly help it. In the revised version, I think I&#8217;ve cracked it. The line is now:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The daughter of a pirate king and Paddington the bear</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which is <em>much</em> easier to sing and follows the rest of the verse by being a more oblique reference to the character. If you know who Pippi is, then it&#8217;s obvious who I&#8217;m singing about. If you don&#8217;t, then maybe I&#8217;ve piqued your curiosity.</p>\n<p>The first recording also had two slightly different tunes for the verses, this version has settled on just the one.</p>\n<p>And, for people who care about that sort of thing, this was recorded with a click track at 110bpm rather than speeding up over the course of the song, which should make life a little easier for anyone taking part in Rabid Gravy&#8217;s <a href=\"http://blog.rabidgravy.com/making-music-to-save-our-libraries\">project</a> to remix and rerecord different versions of the song.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re concerned about Library closures, a good place to start is <a href=\"http://www.voicesforthelibrary.org.uk/\">Voices for the Library</a>. If you&#8217;re on twitter, you might also start following <a href=\"http://twitter.com/ukpling\">@ukpling</a>. If you&#8217;re not concerned about library closures, why on earth did you read this far, and what kind of excuse for a human being are you?</p>"

Most importantly, both of us grew up in houses where no book was out of bounds. Our fathers used to take us to our respective local libraries (Lewisham for Gill, Doncaster Central and then Bawtry for me) every week or so on a Saturday morning. As soon as I was old enough, I&#8217;d ride my bike from our home in Scrooby to Bawtry with a carrier full of books hanging off the handlebars.

076af579-452a-093b-07a8-813d8f20a1a5.description	"<p>In <a href=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2012/09/features-perl-5-needs-in-2012.html\">Features Perl 5 Needs in 2012</a>, I suggested five mostly-not-syntax features that Perl 5 could use right now.</p>\n\n<p>The caveat to all of these features is that 1) someone must <em>code</em>\nthem and 2) someone must <em>maintain</em> them. While p5p has traditionally\ndone a lot with a little, remember that any suggestions or discussions will\nonly make it into a Perl 5 release if enough effort goes into implementation to\nmake them happen. If you want any of these features to happen, contact TPF\nabout donations or volunteer your time and skills to help (even if all you feel\ncomfortable doing is helping to refine the design of a feature, that's\nworthwhile).</p>\n\n<p>I promised to explain these features in more detail. First up is a\nmetaobject protocol for Perl 5. Stevan Little and Jesse Luehrs are working on\n<a href=\"https://github.com/stevan/p5-mop\">a proof of concept MOP for Perl\n5</a>, so this feature is well underway.</p>\n\n<p>If you're not familiar with a metaobject protocol, the book <a\nhref=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Metaobject-Protocol-Gregor-Kiczales/dp/0262610744?tag=onyneopre-20\">The\nArt of the Metaobject Protocol</a> explains everything in extensive detail.\n(It's also a pretty good book about Common Lisp, so if you're interested in a\nsemi-practical theoretical exploration of why computer sciencey things like the\nlambda calculus and well-designed extension mechanisms matter, this is a great\nbook about the design and implementation of a language.)</p>\n\n<p>If you don't want to read ~350 pages right now, the short definition of a\nMOP is <em>an API for interacting with your object system</em>. Classes (if\nyour MOP supports them) are objects. You can define a new class by making\nmethod calls. You can create objects by making method calls. You can define an\nentirely new <em>style</em> of class by creating your own new metaclass with\ndifferent behaviors. This is the reason <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Class::MOP\">Class::MOP</a> predated <a\nhref=\"http://moose.perl.org/\">Moose</a>.</p>\n\n<p>A good MOP provides a great theoretical foundation for a wonderful object\nsystem. Where many of us have defended Perl 5's object system as \"minimal but\neffective and flexible\", a good MOP in the core would let us get rid of\n<code>bless</code> in our code... and have more good features.</p>\n\n<h2>Performance Improvements</h2>\n\n<p>Moose can be slow to start, if you have lots of little classes, all on disk\nin their individual modules. Not only are you doing lots of IO to find and load\nthose classes, but you have to build up all of the classes you've defined in\nmemory through Moose's import mechanism (<code>has()</code> and\n<code>extends()</code> and <code>with()</code> are all function calls) which\ncreates and populates a metaclass behind the scenes.</p>\n\n<p>This happens every time you start your program.</p>\n\n<p>Every MooseX extension you load changes things.</p>\n\n<p>Though some of this happens in XS, where memory use can be smaller (less\nPerl data structure overhead) and speed can be faster (the same algorithm done\nin C instead of something written atop C), much of this happens at the Perl 5\nlevel.</p>\n\n<p>A great MOP could have its own custom data structures and code in the core\nto represent classes and methods and attributes, rather than Perl 5 hashes and\narrays. A great MOP could have its own ops to handle things like introspection\nand dispatch. A great MOP could have parser support to avoid the overhead of\ncalling Perl 5 functions (or crossing the XS boundary) to perform basic\nsetup.</p>\n\n<h2>Simplicity of Alternate Object Systems</h2>\n\n<p>Perl 5's default object system is very flexible for strange people like me\nwho've programmed in far too many languages (and implemented a few) who like\nvarious features of multiple languages and think \"Hey, I know, I'll implement\nthis in Perl 5.\" You bless a reference. You invoke a method. That's it.\nEverything else you can build yourself.</p>\n\n<p>The downside is that you have to figure out how to build it yourself.\nSometimes that means even diving into the source code of Perl 5 <em>itself</em>\nto see how things happen.</p>\n\n<p>A good MOP provides a foundation on which you can provide your own custom\nbehavior. As long as you hew to the protocol it defines, you can do anything\nyou want: make a custom metaclass that allows simple and protected shared\nmemory between workers, provide automatic auditing around specific methods,\nproxy transparently to remote resources, anything.</p>\n\n<p>Better yet...</p>\n\n<h2>Interoperability Between Different Object Systems</h2>\n\n<p>One of the projects I maintain uses Moose heavily. One of its dependencies\npulls in <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Moo\">Moo</a>. The authors of\nboth object systems have gone to great lengths to make sure that both work\ntogether.</p>\n\n<p>With a good MOP in place in the core, you have to go to great lengths\n<em>not to interoperate well with other object systems</em>. The default is\ninteroperability.</p>\n\n<p>(Try that in Perl 5 now, where some of the web programming or IO classes\nbless typeglobs. Oh, you expected a blessed hash? Too bad!)</p>\n\n<h2>Syntactic Improvements</h2>\n\n<p>As I alluded to earlier, a good MOP opens the door for declarative syntaxes\nfor defining classes, methods, and attributes. We might finally get a\n<code>class</code> keyword and a <code>method</code> keyword. This is very nice\nbecause it'll be faster, but also...</p>\n\n<h2>Tool Improvements</h2>\n\n<p>... language keywords the language itself knows make their way into syntax\nhighlighters and static analysis tools and reformatters and refactorers. It's\neasy to get a list of all of the methods in all of the classes in a file when\nit's unambiguous to pick out all of the names of classes in a file because you\n<em>know</em> they all have the <code>class</code> keyword in front of them,\nfor example.</p>\n\n<p>Compare that to today, where anything that looks like a coderef in a\nnamespace is potentially a method or potentially a function and the only way to\nknow is to invoke it, and why bother even trying?</p>\n\n<h2>Current Status</h2>\n\n<p>It's difficult to argue against putting a MOP in the core. Stevan and Jesse\nare working hard on it, but they could use more eyeballs on the tests and\ndesign and certainly more testing on various platforms. If you've been looking\nfor an excuse to contribute to Perl 5.18 or Perl 5.20, this is a great place to\nstart.</p>"

I was right about a couple, wrong about a couple of others, and\nmissed one or two important ones. For those playing along at home, I missed:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A yearly release cycle</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?feature\">feature</a> pragma</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For all its faults, <em>feature</em> broke the logjam by which it was\nimpossible to add new syntax or backwards-incompatible features to Perl 5. The\nmechanism isn't perfect (especially its implementation), but it allows\nprogress, and for that I'm thankful.</p>\n\n<p>I can't predict what will be ready for Perl 5.18 next April or May, but I\ncan update my list to include features I'd like to see in an upcoming release.\nI'll go into more detail of each of these features in future installments.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>A <a href=\"https://github.com/stevan/p5-mop\">metaobject protocol</a> in the\ncore, to improve Perl 5's object system in a well-defined way</li>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2010/10/reinventing-the-axle.html\">A ctypes-like replacement for simple XS</a></li>\n\n<li>A formalized AST between the parser and the code generator, with the\nability to manipulate the AST and inject new subtrees in pure Perl 5</li>\n\n<li>Compact, native-type data structures</li>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2012/09/the-advantages-of-declarative-exporting.html\">Declarative replacements for procedural code</a></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>(For the CL fans in the audience, I <em>like</em> syntax, and I have a lot\nof trouble giving up CPAN's breadth and cross-platform goodness.)</p>\n\n<p>What's on your list?</p>"

2f3aa009-4485-cc31-014b-067380cfe31b.description	"<p>I haven't written an infinite loop bug in a while. I suppose I was due. (The Greek gods always punish hubris.)</p>\n\n<p>I have a database table full of users. Let's call that table\n<code>user</code>. A user has one or more roles (from the <code>role</code>)\ntable. A user can be an unverified user, a free user, a subscriber, or an\nadministrator. (Administrators obviously are also subscribers, but you get the\npoint.)</p>\n\n<p>I use <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?DBIx::Class\">DBIx::Class</a>\nfor the database access layer. My <code>User</code> result class has a couple\nof methods which let other model actions query whether the user can perform\nspecific operations. They're <a\nhref=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2011/05/decoupling-testability-and-synthetic-attributes.html\">synthetic\nattributes</a>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>has [<span class=\"Constant\">qw(</span><span class=\"Constant\"> is_admin is_subscriber </span><span class=\"Constant\">)</span>], <span class=\"Constant\">is</span> =&gt; <span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">ro</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span>, <span class=\"Constant\">lazy_build</span> =&gt; <span class=\"Constant\">1</span>;\n\n<span class=\"Statement\">sub </span><span class=\"Identifier\">_build_is_admin      </span>{ <span class=\"Statement\">shift</span>-&gt;find_role_by_name( <span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">admin</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span>      ) }\n<span class=\"Statement\">sub </span><span class=\"Identifier\">_build_is_subscriber </span>{ <span class=\"Statement\">shift</span>-&gt;find_role_by_name( <span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">subscriber</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span> ) }</code></pre>\n\n<p>Obviously the implementation of <code>find_role_by_name()</code> is\nsupremely important. Here's how I originally wrote the code (no sense blaming\nanyone else for this, because <em>I</em> wrote all of the access control code\nmyself.) See if you can catch the bug:</p>\n\n<pre><code><span class=\"Statement\">sub </span><span class=\"Identifier\">find_role_by_name</span>\n{\n    <span class=\"Statement\">my</span> (<span class=\"Identifier\">$self</span>, <span class=\"Identifier\">$name</span>) = <span class=\"Identifier\">@_</span>;\n\n    <span class=\"Statement\">while</span> (<span class=\"Statement\">my</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$role</span> = <span class=\"Identifier\">$self</span><span class=\"Identifier\">-&gt;user_roles-&gt;next</span>)\n    {\n        <span class=\"Statement\">return</span> <span class=\"Constant\">1</span> <span class=\"Statement\">if</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$role</span><span class=\"Identifier\">-&gt;role-&gt;name</span> <span class=\"Statement\">eq</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$name</span>;\n    }\n\n    <span class=\"Statement\">return</span> <span class=\"Constant\">0</span>;\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>As a hint, the <code>user_roles</code> method represents the relationship\nbetween the <code>user</code> table and the <code>role</code> table. That\nmethod returns a DBIC resultset which represents the entries in the table with\na foreign key to the <code>user</code> table.</p>\n\n<p>See the bug yet? It took me a while. The problem is that <em>every\ninvocation of the loop</em> fetches a new resultset. Every invocation of the\nloop fetches only the <em>first</em> result from that resultset.</p>\n\n<p>My tests (yeah, I wrote the tests too, before I wrote this code in fact,\njust like you're supposed to do) didn't catch that because the rest of the code\nonly ever checked for one user role, the administrator role, anywhere else.\nOnly when I added code for the subscriber role did the subscription tests\ntrigger this infinite loop. (Now how abhorred in my imagination is that most\nexcellent jest!)</p>\n\n<p>I wish I could say that I diagnosed the cause immediately. I didn't. I\nstared at the code for far too long, until I had the presence of mind to put a\ndebugging statement in the loop body to print the name of the role.  (Stat\nofficium pristina nomine.)</p>\n\n<p>Here's the corrected code, with a single expression hoisted into a scalar\nvariable where it may endure properly:</p>\n\n<pre><code><span class=\"Statement\">sub </span><span class=\"Identifier\">find_role_by_name</span>\n{\n    <span class=\"Statement\">my</span> (<span class=\"Identifier\">$self</span>, <span class=\"Identifier\">$name</span>) = <span class=\"Identifier\">@_</span>;\n    <span class=\"Statement\">my</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$user_roles_rs</span> = <span class=\"Identifier\">$self</span><span class=\"Identifier\">-&gt;user_roles</span>;\n\n    <span class=\"Statement\">while</span> (<span class=\"Statement\">my</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$role</span> = <span class=\"Identifier\">$user_roles_rs</span><span class=\"Identifier\">-&gt;next</span>)\n    {\n        <span class=\"Statement\">return</span> <span class=\"Constant\">1</span> <span class=\"Statement\">if</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$role</span><span class=\"Identifier\">-&gt;role-&gt;name</span> <span class=\"Statement\">eq</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$name</span>;\n    }\n\n    <span class=\"Statement\">return</span> <span class=\"Constant\">0</span>;\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>I will say this: expecting your test suite to pass in under 30 seconds makes this sort of thing much easier to catch. If I'd had to wait for a continuous integration server to get around to checking this commit, I wouldn't have fixed it as quickly as I did.</p>\n\n<p>Then again, it's easier to debug bugs you never write in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>Oh, and if you catch the literary allusion in the title, here's your prize:\ncongratulations! You might be overeducated. (If you caught the other three\nallusions, have you ever noticed how much Pynchon's <em>V</em> influenced\nStephenson's <em>Cryptonomicon</em>?)</p>"

Consider\ntypical Moose code:</p>\n\n<pre><code><span class=\"Statement\">package</span><span class=\"Type\"> MyApp::App::Role::HasMailer</span>;\n<span class=\"Comment\"># ABSTRACT: role which provides other app roles with a mailer</span>\n\n<span class=\"Statement\">use </span>Modern::Perl;\n<span class=\"Statement\">use </span>Moose::Role;\n\n<span class=\"Statement\">use </span>MyApp::Mailer;\n\nhas <span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">mailer</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span>, <span class=\"Constant\">is</span> =&gt; <span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">ro</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span>, <span class=\"Constant\">lazy_build</span> =&gt; <span class=\"Constant\">1</span>;\n\n<span class=\"Statement\">sub </span><span class=\"Identifier\">_build_mailer</span>\n{\n    <span class=\"Statement\">my</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$self</span>        = <span class=\"Statement\">shift</span>;\n    <span class=\"Statement\">my</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$config</span>      = <span class=\"Statement\">do</span> <span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">myapp_local.pl</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span>;\n    <span class=\"Statement\">my</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$mail_client</span> = <span class=\"Identifier\">$config-&gt;{</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">Model::UserMail</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Identifier\">}</span><span class=\"Identifier\">{</span><span class=\"Constant\">mail_client</span><span class=\"Identifier\">}</span>;\n    <span class=\"Statement\">return</span> MyApp::Mailer-&gt;new( <span class=\"Identifier\">$mail_client</span> );\n}\n\n<span class=\"Constant\">1</span>;</code></pre>\n\n<p>... where functions such as <code>has</code> and <code>with</code> and\n<code>extends</code> look like declarations (such as <code>my</code> and\n<code>sub</code>), but are actually code to run.</p>\n\n<p>The difference is important. A declaration that's part of the language's\ngrammar need only be <em>parsed</em> to have its effects take place, while a\nstatement or expression needs to <em>run</em> to take place.</p>\n\n<p>This is, of course, why variable declarations makes lexical scoping trivial\nto understand for experienced Perl programmers, why binding closures to their\nlexical environments is easy in the simple cases, and why binding closures to\ntheir lexical environments when you use the STRING form of <code>eval</code> is\nso difficult.</p>\n\n<p>As Moose hackers will tell you, Moose isn't a simple preprocessor you run\nover your code once to generate <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Moose::Manual::Unsweetened\">longer, uglier\ncode without syntactic goodness</a>. Instead, <a\nhref=\"http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=685459\">classes are built, not\ndeclared</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This is endemic to Moose, but it's not a characteristic specific to Modern\nPerl. It's inherent in Perl 5 itself, even the 1994 version. <a\nhref=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2009/08/how-a-perl-5-program-works.html\">Perl\n5 lets you run arbitrary code while parsing happens</a>.</p>\n\n<p>While you can gain tremendous flexibility with this approach (building up\nclosures with partially applied arguments to export to caller namespaces), you\ncan't serialize the resulting code as easily because you may have to run\narbitrary code to restore your program in memory.</p>\n\n<p>Put another way, <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Exporter\">Exporter</a> is a library while\nit should be core language behavior.</p>\n\n<p>In the simple case where a library wants to export a couple of symbols into\nthe caller's namespace, say <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> from <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?List::Util\">List::Util</a>, why is there\nno simple syntax for marking those symbols as exportable in\n<code>List::Util</code> without having to run code (or worse yet, <em>inherit\nfrom</em>) <code>Exporter</code>?</p>\n\n<p>If a declarative syntax existed&mdash;with language support or at least the\nbroad consistency to allow for tool support&mdash;such that it were statically\npossible to determine the symbols exported from one package and imported into\nanother package, precompilation would be easier. A module could have a static\nlist of exports provided in a manifest of sorts. (A good optimizer could even\ndecline to import unused code!)</p>\n\n<p>I realize it isn't always possible to reduce all cases of exporting to a\nlist of static symbols (nor is it desirable to remove that power), but at least\n80% of the code I write would benefit from this. We'd also be able to have\nbetter tool support for the language; it would be easier to discover which\nsymbols come from where, and we might even close the \"You can't always tell\nwhich of two interpretations of a parse tree is valid in Perl 5 code thanks to\n<code>import</code> and <code>BEGIN</code>\" gap a little further.</p>\n\n<p>(... but then someone will ask why <code>strict</code> is a pragma and not\ncore language behavior, especially after looking at its implementation, and\nthen we'll all go to the paint store to pick out our favorite colors. See also \"I didn't provide an example of this declarative syntax, so you can't argue about it in the comments.\")</p>"

018d6650-5b87-5b15-a0b8-5196be36cd12.description	"<p>One of my work projects has a test suite that's grown a little too slow for\nmy liking. With only a few hundred tests, I've seen our test runs take over 30\nseconds in a couple of cases. We're diligent about separating tests into\nindividual logical files, so that when we work on a feature we can run only its\ntests as we develop and save running the whole suite for the last verification\nbefore checkin, but 30 seconds is still too long.</p>\n\n<p>(Before you ask, <a\nhref=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2011/11/parallelism-and-test-suites.html\">our\ntest suite is fully parallelizable</a>, so that 30 seconds keeps all of the\ncores on a development box at full usage.)</p>\n\n<p>I realize that one fad in software of the last few years is continuous\nintegration, where you submit your commits to a box somewhere for that to run\nthe full test suite and email you if something goes wrong, sometime in the\nfuture, hopefully less than an hour from now. Hopefully.</p>\n\n<p>We can't afford to wait that long to know if our code is right. (I like to\npush to our production box as soon as we have well-tested fixes that we know\nwork reliably. That's often more than once per day. I'm the only one working on\nthe site today, and I've already pushed three changes, with at least one more\ncoming.)</p>\n\n<p>When I worked on <a href=\"http://parrotcode.org/\">Parrot</a>, I spent a lot\nof time profiling the VM to sneak out small performance improvements here and\nthere, using less memory and far fewer CPU cycles. I'm at home in a profiler,\nso I picked a very small test program and ran it through <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Devel::NYTProf\">Devel::NYTProf</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I've mentioned before that this application has a <a\nhref=\"http://catalystframework.org/\">Catalyst</a> frontend which takes full\nadvantage of <a href=\"http://moose.perl.org/\">Moose</a> throughout. It uses <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?DBIx::Class\">DBIx::Class</a> as its\npersistence layer.</p>\n\n<p>As you might expect, <em>startup</em> time dominates most of the tests. We\nhave 21 individual test files, and startup took close to two seconds for each\nof them. No matter how much we parallelized, we were always going to spend no\nless than 40 total seconds running tests. (The non-parallel test suite runs in\n~67 seconds, so parallelization already gives a 55% improvement.)</p>\n\n<p>When I looked at the profile, I saw that most of the startup time came from\na couple of dependencies we didn't need.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, even though I use <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?HTML::FormHandler\">HTML::FormHandler</a>\nquite happily on another project, we don't use it on this project at all. We\ndid use a Catalyst plugin which brought it in as a dependency, but we never\nused that feature.</p>\n\n<p>I spent an hour revising that part of our application to remove that plugin\n(which we used to use, then customized our code so that the plugin was almost\nvestigial) and the parallel test run went down to 23 seconds.</p>\n\n<p>We trimmed 10% of our dependencies, just by removing one plugin and the code\nit brought in.</p>\n\n<p>(Tip: use <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Devel::TraceUse\">Devel::TraceUse</a> to\nfind out which modules load which modules. It's a good way to get the\nconceptual weight of a dependency.)</p>\n\n<p>I don't shy away from dependencies when they're useful, but I ended up\nrevising one file and ending up with <em>less</em> code overall than we had\nbefore I started.</p>\n\n<p>With that said, there's clearly room for improvement. I traced through some\nMoose code which handles initialization (especially of attributes) and it seems\nlike there should be some efficiency gains there. Similarly, both Catalyst and\nDBIC go through some contortions to load plugins and components that in my case\nwere unnecessary. (I have a patch to consider for the former, but not the\nlatter.)</p>\n\n<p>Two things I learned do bother me somewhat. If you use\n<code>Devel::TraceUse</code> on a project of any size, you'll see a lot of\ninconsistency and duplication, thanks to years of TIMTOWTDI. Catalyst brings in\nMoose, but DBIC eventually ends up bringing in <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Moo\">Moo</a>. No one can decide whether to\nuse <code>@ISA</code> or <code>use base '...';</code> or <code>use parent\n'...';</code>. A lot of larger projects (DateTime, Moose extensions) have lots\nof helper modules spread out in lots of tiny <em>.pm</em> files which each need\nto be located, loaded, and compiled.</p>\n\n<p>Worse, all of the nice declarative syntax you get with some of these modern\nlibraries has a cost behind the scenes every time you run the program <em>even\nif nothing has changed</em>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=990666\">If I were to pick an\noptimization target for future versions of Perl 5</a>, I'd want a good way for\nMoose or Catalyst or whatever to precompile my nice sugared code into a cached\nrepresentation that could then load faster on subsequent invocations. (I know\nyou're not getting an order of magnitude improvement here: you still have to\nset up stubs for metaclasses and the like, but even getting attributes and\nmethods in place would be an improvement!)</p>\n\n<p>I'd settle today for a preforking test suite that doesn't require me to\nrewrite all of my tests.</p>\n\n<p>Then again, that ~25% improvement in test execution from removing one\ndependency isn't bad for the week either.</p>"

Originally started as a small gathering of Dungeons &amp; Dragons co-creator Gary Gygax’s friends, GenCon now finds itself the capstone event amidst a kind of golden age for so-called hobby games. Board gamers, role-playing gamers, LARPers, and war gamers all sit shoulder to shoulder in its massive play spaces, while buskers vie for their attention on the nearly 400-strong vendor floor. Boosted by satellite events like PAX and the un-closeting of an emboldened gamer population at large, there’s plenty of room for continued growth.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">Buried inside the sacred tome that is GenCon’s annual program, amidst the thousands of play sessions of new and old properties, was a listing for an entirely new event—a keynote presentation. To no one’s surprise, the keynote presentation was given by Wizards of the Coast (WotC). Their goal? To rally the faithful around their grand experiment called \"D&amp;D Next.\"</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">The time of troubles</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">The Dungeons &amp; Dragons family of games has been in and out of a state of civil war throughout its history. Call them “The Edition Wars.” OD&amp;D begat AD&amp;D which begat Third Edition, and with each transition came, if not enmity within the ranks, then perhaps the kind of gentle chiding that siblings have for one another across the dinner table. But nothing ruined Thanksgiving quite like the row that developed over the release of Dungeons &amp; Dragons Fourth Edition, colloquially known as D&amp;D 4e.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/09/getting-back-to-the-story-hands-on-with-dungeons-dragons-next/\">Read 27 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/09/getting-back-to-the-story-hands-on-with-dungeons-dragons-next/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/IjyOG5Vw2xSncJG_esEnIyBuOFI/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/IjyOG5Vw2xSncJG_esEnIyBuOFI/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/IjyOG5Vw2xSncJG_esEnIyBuOFI/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/IjyOG5Vw2xSncJG_esEnIyBuOFI/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/Iia7rbYaslk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

This seems easy at first. When the game begins, you invariably find yourself on a sandy beach somewhere, and a bit of experimentation quickly yields the knowledge that you can affect your environment by punching things. You can punch trees to break them apart and collect wood, for instance, which you can use to make tools, which you can use to gather more materials, which you can use to make more things. You'll just be getting the hang of the basic mechanics when night falls—and the zombies and skeletons and spiders and creepers come out to collect your soul.</p>\n<p>As the game grew more popular, Persson (known to fans by his in-game handle \"Notch\") hired staff and eventually turned over daily programming duties to other folks. These days, Notch spends his days developing other games and being <a href=\"http://penny-arcade.com/report/editorial-article/notch-interview\">interviewed</a> by famous Internet journalists, while <em>Minecraft</em> thrives on multiple platforms including PC, Mac, Linux, and XBox 360.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/09/blocks-with-friends-how-to-run-your-own-minecraft-server/\">Read 65 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/09/blocks-with-friends-how-to-run-your-own-minecraft-server/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/gF8kfzrsazCB0-hzE8UhHqMiCEY/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/gF8kfzrsazCB0-hzE8UhHqMiCEY/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/gF8kfzrsazCB0-hzE8UhHqMiCEY/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/gF8kfzrsazCB0-hzE8UhHqMiCEY/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/9tqTYR55SPM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

For every characteristic that we associate with a particular sex, the animal kingdom harbors at least one surprising exception; concepts that we believe are inextricably linked are uncoupled, and even reversed, in other species.</p>\n<p>Our sex exerts an incredible influence on our lives, influencing anatomy, appearance, behavior, and countless other traits. Socially, our sex also matters in terms of how we are understood and treated by others, because we see each other through a gendered lens. <a href=\"http://www.naceweb.org/gender/\">Female college graduates</a> are hired more often than male graduates, for instance, but earn 17 percent less than their male counterparts.

Available both as part of Server 2012 and as a free (as in beer) standalone installation, the third generation of Hyper-V brings with it a collection of features that largely commoditize the sorts of things you’ve gotten used to having to pay extra for. There are even a few features you couldn’t do <em>at all</em> with other hypervisors (like live migration of a server from one server to another with no shared storage between the two).</p>\n<p>Hyper-V supports a host of high-availability and “resiliency” features, such as off-site replication of servers. And it does many of those things as well or better than offerings from VMware and Citrix—regardless of whether you’re virtualizing Windows servers, Windows desktops, or Linux. And then there’s the free part: while the licenses for Windows Server itself are tied to a specific set of hardware, other operating systems can be hosted on the standalone Hyper-V server and managed as part of the same environment. All with the same sort of manageability.</p>\n<p>In this first look at Hyper-V 2012, we look at some of the high points of the hypervisor and its management environment from the perspective of a small to mid-sized enterprise. While many of the new features have been available on other virtualization platforms for some time, Hyper-V matters largely because of the way that Microsoft has tied them all up in a relatively simple and inexpensive package. This could potentially save organizations a significant amount of money—while preserving their sanity as well.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/09/first-look-hyper-v-2012-targets-vmwares-air-supply/\">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/09/first-look-hyper-v-2012-targets-vmwares-air-supply/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/qGk5X-tfvdXUa6UX_AQ5sUk8DJc/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/qGk5X-tfvdXUa6UX_AQ5sUk8DJc/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/qGk5X-tfvdXUa6UX_AQ5sUk8DJc/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/qGk5X-tfvdXUa6UX_AQ5sUk8DJc/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/FixehGsitwM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

Behind Door Number One sits a free-to-watch service that uses off-the-shelf technology and that buffers just enough of each show to put the live stream on the Internet. Behind Door Number Two lies a subscription service that requires custom-designed hardware and makes dozens of copies of each show. Which sounds easier to build—and to use? More importantly, which is more likely to be legal?</p>\n<p>If you went with Door Number One, then you are a sane person, untainted by the depravity of modern copyright law. But you are also wrong.

CSC Holdings</em></a> (which everyone just calls \"Cablevision\"). The tech at issue in Cablevision was a \"DVR in the cloud,\" and because of the way the Second Circuit answered the question of whether a DVR \"performs\" a copyrighted TV show when the user hits \"play,\" the decision opened a whole range of possibilities for entrepreneurs willing to mash up technologies in ways God never intended.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/08/why-johnny-cant-stream-how-video-copyright-went-insane/\">Read 55 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/08/why-johnny-cant-stream-how-video-copyright-went-insane/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/eNJPTR7HyFJtONmnLI6gytSKGcg/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/eNJPTR7HyFJtONmnLI6gytSKGcg/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/eNJPTR7HyFJtONmnLI6gytSKGcg/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/eNJPTR7HyFJtONmnLI6gytSKGcg/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/AV9Uj-x5zmc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

That technology, supplied by a subsidiary of the French IT firm Bull, used a technique called deep packet inspection (DPI) to capture e-mails, chat messages, and Web visits of Libyan citizens.</p>\n<p>The fact that the Qaddafi regime was using deep packet inspection technology wasn’t surprising. Many governments have invested heavily in packet inspection and related technologies, which allow them to build a picture of what passes through their networks and what comes in from beyond their borders. The tools secure networks from attack—and help keep tabs on citizens.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.narus.com/\">Narus</a>, a subsidiary of Boeing, supplies “cyber analytics” to a customer base largely made up of government agencies and network carriers. Neil Harrington, the company’s director of product management for cyber analytics, said that his company’s “enterprise” customers—agencies of the US government and large telecommunications companies—are ”more interested in what's going on inside their networks” for security reasons. But some of Narus’ other customers, like Middle Eastern governments that own their nations’ connections to the global Internet or control the companies that provide them, “are more interested in what people are doing on Facebook and Twitter.”</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/08/big-brother-meets-big-data-the-next-wave-in-net-surveillance-tech/\">Read 63 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/08/big-brother-meets-big-data-the-next-wave-in-net-surveillance-tech/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/C0feMutPRInXFsJpDul1xmeaaoU/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/C0feMutPRInXFsJpDul1xmeaaoU/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/C0feMutPRInXFsJpDul1xmeaaoU/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/C0feMutPRInXFsJpDul1xmeaaoU/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/3w0FQVI8TU8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

Since the first models hit the market, the Ultrabook moniker—originally created to denote a thin, light laptop using a low-voltage Intel processor and a fast solid-state drive—has come to encompass just about any laptop that is thinner or lighter than usual.</p>\n<p>Acer's Aspire Timeline M5-481TG is one such computer. Acer officially refers to it as an Ultrabook, but its 14\" screen and 4.3 pound weight definitely push the limits of the term. That said, the M5 uses the extra size and weight to its advantage, packing a dedicated graphics processor and a DVD burner into a relatively thin-and-light frame. It's not the fastest gaming notebook on the market, and it's definitely not the thinnest and lightest. But can this laptop's specs make it a solid all-rounder, or does the approach simply produce a chunky, compromised Ultrabook?</p>\n<table class=\"specifications center\" width=\"500\">\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\" colspan=\"2\">Specs at a glance: Acer Aspire Timeline Ultra M5-481TG</th>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<th>Screen</th>\n<td>1366x768 at 14\" (112 ppi)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<th>OS</th>\n<td>Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<th>CPU</th>\n<td>1.7GHz Intel Core i5-3317U (Turbo boost up to 2.6GHz)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<th>RAM</th>\n<td>4GB 1333MHz DDR3 (officially supports up to 6GB, reports say it can support 10GB)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<th>GPU</th>\n<td>1GB NVIDIA GeForce GT 640M LE and Intel HD Graphics 4000 (switchable)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<th>HDD</th>\n<td>2.5” 5400RPM 500GB hard drive, 20GB SSD</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<th>Networking</th>\n<td>Gigabit Ethernet, dual-band 802.11n, Bluetooth 4.0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<th>Ports</th>\n<td>2x USB 3.0, HDMI, card reader, headphones</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<th>Size</th>\n<td>13.4\" x 0.8\" x 9.6\"</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<th>Weight</th>\n<td>4.30 lbs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<th>Battery</th>\n<td>3-cell 4850 mAh Li-ion</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<th>Price as reviewed</th>\n<td><a href=\"http://us.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/model/NX.M27AA.001\">$779.99</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<th>Other perks</th>\n<td>Webcam, backlit keyboard, DVD burner, 1 year warranty</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Design and build quality</h2>\n<p>The M5 is constructed entirely from plastic—the lid, display bezel, and top case are all dark gray and have a faux-brushed metal look, while the bottom of the laptop is a black, textured matte plastic. There's a bit of flexing in the top case, especially in the lid, but the laptop has a nice dense feel to it and doesn't feel overly cheap in spite of its construction. The M5 is of a uniform, 0.8\" thickness throughout, with none of the tapering seen in many Ultrabooks, and the laptop's lid sits flush with its slightly raised LCD hinge when closed. The hinge itself feels sturdy, but not so stiff that you can't open the laptop without holding the bottom down.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/trying-to-have-it-all-acers-timeline-m5-gaming-ultrabook/\">Read 35 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/trying-to-have-it-all-acers-timeline-m5-gaming-ultrabook/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/QBnChJFy55yrEvKPOY-GQ89y3g8/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/QBnChJFy55yrEvKPOY-GQ89y3g8/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/QBnChJFy55yrEvKPOY-GQ89y3g8/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/QBnChJFy55yrEvKPOY-GQ89y3g8/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/o0lGdZeWgcg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

Well, \"watching\" per se. You're actually staring into the ever-present glow of your smartphone ready to read an urgent memo from your boss; hoping to next check live stats because you're <em>so close</em> to finally winning a fantasy football game.</p>\n<p>Then, tragedy strikes—your phone is showing five bars, but it's slowed to a crawl. You check the available WiFi networks: \"Free Stadium WiFi.\" You select, but deep in your heart you know there's no chance of connecting up here, 100 feet below the cloud cover. And that's when you come to a horrific realization: I'm going to have to put my phone in my pocket and <em>actually</em> pay attention.</p>\n<p>It's a “scary” thought for sports fans: Someday soon, the wireless network at your favorite team’s stadium could be so congested you’ll actually be forced to—gasp!—watch the game you paid a ticket for. People like Katee Panter, VP of infrastructure technology at Madison Square Garden in New York, fear growing use of smartphones and tablets to surf the Web or stream video will make it difficult to provide cellular and WiFi connections for everyone. Teams are taking advantage of fans' handheld devices by building apps to serve up interactive experiences or provide an easier way to order food and beverages. But delivering wireless Internet connections to tens of thousands of densely packed people is no easy technological feat.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/features/2012/08/why-your-smart-device-cant-get-wifi-in-the-home-teams-stadium/\">Read 27 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/features/2012/08/why-your-smart-device-cant-get-wifi-in-the-home-teams-stadium/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/t_liO1P8J2caH3JyrMGeIDQQnk0/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/t_liO1P8J2caH3JyrMGeIDQQnk0/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/t_liO1P8J2caH3JyrMGeIDQQnk0/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/t_liO1P8J2caH3JyrMGeIDQQnk0/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/KIAxQJTRi7o\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

40dd175b-e132-b42b-732b-3b28efd25b3a.description	"<p>We had such hopes for Intel's Ultrabook movement. With the first clarion call, we <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2011/09/ultrabook-intels-300-million-plan-to-beat-apple-at-its-own-game/\">dreamed of a PC</a> that would shatter Apple's monopoly on high-quality ultra-thin-and-light notebooks. In the first year of the Ultrabook campaign, we saw a few possible claimants to the throne, but in general, each entry was more disappointing than the last. The machines became notorious for using workarounds like larger screens (a 14-inch monitor in a 13-inch body!) and hard disk drives with flash caches (rather than actual solid-state drives) to skirt Intel's Ultrabook speed and size requirements.</p>\n<p>Nearly a year after Intel launched the initiative, manufacturers have finally taken the Ultrabook specs to heart. Lenovo's ThinkPad X1 Carbon reflects what we feel is the <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/01/ultra-in-name-only-the-failures-of-intels-ultrabook-rules/\">true spirit of an Ultrabook</a>: a light, thin body with powerful internals. Lenovo gets it. At long last, PCs have a real shot at the segment Apple has been dominating for years with the MacBook Air.</p>\n<div class=\"image center full-width\" style=\"width:640px\"><img src=\"http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/thinkpad_x1_carbon_keyboard.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"508\"></div>\n<h2>The touch, the feel of rubberized silicone</h2>\n<p>First, the waifish body: at a base 2.99 pounds, 0.31 inches at its thinnest point, and 0.74 inches at its thickest, the X1 Carbon has similar dimensions to the MacBook Air (2.96 pounds and 0.68 inches at its thickest). But that's the 13-inch MacBook Air; the X1 Carbon actually has a 14-inch 1600×900 screen packed into a \"13-inch body,\" as hardware manufacturers are recently so fond of saying. The extra display area is noticeable compared to a 13-inch computer, yet our backs and shoulders don't suffer any more for the extra real estate. And when we say 13-inch body, we mean it; the X1 Carbon is 13.03 inches wide by 8.9 inches deep, comparing well with the MacBook Air at 12.8 by 8.94 inches.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/a-worthy-ultrabook-appears-the-thinkpad-x1-carbon-reviewed/\">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/a-worthy-ultrabook-appears-the-thinkpad-x1-carbon-reviewed/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/EKJppYCqOw0fihWnleJoA8zArOg/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/EKJppYCqOw0fihWnleJoA8zArOg/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/EKJppYCqOw0fihWnleJoA8zArOg/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/EKJppYCqOw0fihWnleJoA8zArOg/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/yu-uBCAu2t8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

To give you some guidance in this back-to-school season, we've set up three basic laptop categories. <strong>Basic laptops</strong> emphasize price over performance or size; <strong>gaming laptops</strong> emphasize performance over price or size; and <strong>lightweight laptops</strong> emphasize size over price or performance. Each is further subdivided into price ranges.</p>\n<p>Every category features picks that, in our view, represent some of the best machines available now. In most cases, we've also included a few alternatives in case something about our main pick was a dealbreaker for you.

But the prosecutors sitting across the courtroom from him didn't work for the Crown—they were lawyers for the movie studio trade group Federation Against Copyright Theft (FACT).</p>\n<p>FACT, not public officials in the UK, was the driving force behind Vickerman's prosecution. Indeed, FACT effectively took on the role of a private law enforcement agency. Private investigators hired by FACT first identified Vickerman as the administrator of STC and built the case against him. His assets were frozen at FACT's request by a government agency—which was itself funded by FACT. And when the UK's public prosecutors decided not to press charges against Vickerman at all, FACT initiated a criminal prosecution on its own dime.</p>\n<p>This is a new development for anti-piracy efforts. Organizations like the MPAA, RIAA, IFPA, and FACT have long lobbied law enforcement officials to prosecute \"rogue sites\" and have provided them with information and logistical support to do so. But public prosecutors generally have the final say on who will be indicted. In the Vickerman case, the public prosecutors concluded that there wasn't enough evidence to merit prosecution. FACT disagreed and invoked what one lawyer told us is an \"archaic right\" for a private organization to bring criminal prosecutions against other private parties.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/08/private-justice-how-hollywood-money-put-a-brit-behind-bars/\">Read 44 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/08/private-justice-how-hollywood-money-put-a-brit-behind-bars/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/dLRxJ5Go-chXQxIhSNJvsqH5wZY/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/dLRxJ5Go-chXQxIhSNJvsqH5wZY/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/dLRxJ5Go-chXQxIhSNJvsqH5wZY/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/dLRxJ5Go-chXQxIhSNJvsqH5wZY/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/LKpXpY0nyuA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

With the rise of whole new classes of \"personal computers\"—tablets and smartphones—it's worth updating all the numbers once more. And when we do so, we see something surprising: the adoption rates for our beloved mobile devices absolutely blow away the last few decades of desktop computer growth. People are adopting new technology faster than ever before.</p>\n<p>Humans are naturally competitive creatures. Not only do we compete with each other for money and power, but we form strong allegiances to various tribes. Whether it's a favorite sports team or a chosen computing platform, we passionately cheer when they win and feel a punch in our guts when they lose. Companies know this, and they will trumpet their successes and quietly hide their failures. But is it any more important to want one multi-billion dollar company to win over another than it is to root for one arbitrary multi-million dollar athlete? Is it anything more than cheerleading?</p>\n\n<p>Well—there's certainly plenty of cheerleading, but tracking the rise of fall of market share over time has more serious uses, too. Software developers need to keep track of market share so they can decide where to invest their resources. Consumers may then choose platforms based on software availability. Platforms can live—and sometimes die—by market share. The successes and failures of one generation of platforms affect the next, and ultimately this has an impact on everyone's digital lives.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/business/2012/08/from-altair-to-ipad-35-years-of-personal-computer-market-share/\">Read 50 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/business/2012/08/from-altair-to-ipad-35-years-of-personal-computer-market-share/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/flSZkEK2_wLwv67uQ_nkbYUcorc/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/flSZkEK2_wLwv67uQ_nkbYUcorc/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/flSZkEK2_wLwv67uQ_nkbYUcorc/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/flSZkEK2_wLwv67uQ_nkbYUcorc/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/jYz2MMZLQqY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

It builds on the voice actions system that Google offered in previous versions of Android, adding support for natural language queries, but it also has a passive mode in which it will display contextually relevant information through Android’s notification system. Between the two approaches, Google Now can do all sorts of things.</p>\n<div class=\"image right\" style=\"width:300px\"><img src=\"http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/2012-07-14-17.53.371-300x533.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"533\"><div class=\"caption\"><div class=\"caption-text\">It knows the important stuff.</div> </div></div>\n<p>The voice control interface in Google Now operates much like Apple’s Siri; the software records and interprets the user’s voice, parsing full sentences of natural speech into commands. It responds by speaking back to the user and displaying relevant information. You can use the speech interface to dictate an e-mail or text message, search Google, perform a calculation or unit conversion, get the definition of a word, get a stock quote, search the platform’s built-in addressbook, set an alarm, play a song, get travel directions, get the current weather conditions in a region, or launch an application. The range of supported commands and queries is comparable to Siri's.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/review-androids-google-now-can-teach-siri-a-few-tricks/\">Read 43 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/review-androids-google-now-can-teach-siri-a-few-tricks/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/wI2qe0RCBRrNx0yq0Nt41V6Eahc/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/wI2qe0RCBRrNx0yq0Nt41V6Eahc/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/wI2qe0RCBRrNx0yq0Nt41V6Eahc/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/wI2qe0RCBRrNx0yq0Nt41V6Eahc/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/nkwuBC0j31Y\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

Its absence was brutally disappointing; thankfully, Tim Cook broke his vow of secrecy to reassure us that a new Mac Pro will arrive in 2013. But for filmmakers compressing hours of 4K footage or school labs in need of new Maya machines, that’s a long time to wait—perhaps too long. Since I was also in the market for a machine to help out with my V-Ray renders, I decided that the time had come to evaluate my alternatives. The current Westmere-based Mac Pro line is definitely out of sync with what’s available elsewhere, and it is no longer competitive from a price-to-power standpoint.</p>\n<p>I have heard it said that Dell, HP, and Apple split the workstation market pretty much three ways; whether or not this is true, it did seem worth taking a look at how the other big boys’ hot-rods rolled. The HP Z820 and Dell Precision T5600 are both monstrous dual-socket Intel E5-2665 Xeons clocked at 2.4GHz and, if I had to guess, I’d say that they are much like what would have replaced the dual Westmere Xeon 2.66GHz Mac Pro <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/2010/10/tri-screen-cpu-monitor-ars-reviews-the-12-core-2010-mac-pro/\">that I reviewed in 2010</a>.</p>\n<p>Of course, you can still build your own workstation, but I’m writing this for an audience who needs top-tier support and doesn’t want to chase six different companies when something goes wrong. I have my own overclocked 3930K gaming rig dual-booting Linux and Windows, but as I’ve pointed out countless times in the comments section of my Mac Pro reviews, a workstation needs to do one thing: keep working. Vendor support remains key to making this happen.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/as-mac-pro-stagnates-pc-workstations-muscle-ahead/\">Read 93 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/as-mac-pro-stagnates-pc-workstations-muscle-ahead/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/fn_wIMbfc-7y7iitMeT2152bWG0/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/fn_wIMbfc-7y7iitMeT2152bWG0/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/fn_wIMbfc-7y7iitMeT2152bWG0/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/fn_wIMbfc-7y7iitMeT2152bWG0/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/Xuqtj50gGio\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

Venus is similar in size and mass to our planet, but its broiling hot surface temperature and sulfuric acid rain put some hard limits on comparisons; other interesting worlds lack atmospheres or are frozen over. But Mars has potential. Despite the thin carbon dioxide atmosphere and low surface gravity (if you weigh 150 pounds on Earth, you'd only weigh 56 pounds on Mars), the planet is just enough like Earth to offer the promise of habitability—whether in the future by humans, or in the past or present by native life forms.</p>\n<p>So it's no surprise that Mars was an exploration target from the very beginning of spaceflight. The first missions sent to Mars by the Soviet Union began in 1960, a scant three years after Sputnik. The first successful flyby came in 1965 with NASA's Mariner 4, and the first successful landing was the Soviet Mars 3 in 1971. That lander ceased transmission soon after touchdown, which is common on the Red Planet—Wikipedia's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration_of_Mars#Timeline\">timeline of Mars exploration</a> is a sobering read for that very reason.</p>\n<p>The many failures make the successful landings look even more amazing. With the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover, known as Curiosity, arriving on-planet August 6, we're going to take a look back at the landers and rovers that brought us to today.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/2012/08/mars-needs-rovers-and-its-getting-a-big-one/\">Read 26 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/2012/08/mars-needs-rovers-and-its-getting-a-big-one/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/7If4mo7pHL6NUwUJCl060HfIlag/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/7If4mo7pHL6NUwUJCl060HfIlag/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/7If4mo7pHL6NUwUJCl060HfIlag/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/7If4mo7pHL6NUwUJCl060HfIlag/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/RgP-rDJvKi0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

Founded by the former senior VP of Apple's iPod division, Tony Fadell, along with his partner Matt Rogers, Nest Labs set out to create what is essentially the iPod of the thermostat world. The round, user-friendly device was initially met with excellent reviews, but were these based in reality or were they the result of some Apple-like hype?</p>\n<p>I like to think of myself as somewhat of a thermostat nerd. (Listen, it doesn't sound very exciting because it's not, but I like them). I am fascinated by thermostats and their usability, but I also don't like to spend too much money on them—unless the extra cost is worth it. Friends and Twitter followers have long asked me to evaluate higher-end thermostats, and I'm always examining the thermostats at other people's houses. So when I finally had the opportunity to install a Nest, I jumped at it.</p>\n<p>Now that I've been using the Nest for several months, I have a pretty good feel for its strengths and weaknesses—at least compared to what is typically available on the market. Is the Nest really worth the $250 it costs to obtain one, just so you can have a fancier way of turning the temperature up and down? I think so—especially if you're the \"convenience oriented\" type (that's PC for \"lazy\").</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/a-thermostat-that-learns-three-months-with-the-nest/\">Read 44 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/a-thermostat-that-learns-three-months-with-the-nest/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/Jgvmmo8M68VUN6mGvaW8S6RYeLU/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/Jgvmmo8M68VUN6mGvaW8S6RYeLU/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/Jgvmmo8M68VUN6mGvaW8S6RYeLU/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/Jgvmmo8M68VUN6mGvaW8S6RYeLU/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/vdYSbKar1us\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

Certainly no patron drinking beer and shooting miniature basketballs into a miniature hoop expected their credit card data to end up inside an encrypted Latvian server, waiting to be sold off to international criminals who would ring up more than $600,000 in charges on the cards. But that was because no patron knew anything about the Estonian hacker Aleksandr \"JonnyHell\" Suvorov.</p>\n<p>On May 18, 2007, Suvorov electronically entered the point of sale (POS) server at store #32. Every Dave &amp; Buster's has a POS server, which vacuums up all the credit card data collected by each store's credit card swipe terminals and relays it upstream to a payment processor for verification and approval of the transaction. With full access to the server, Suvorov had no trouble installing a customized bit of code called a packet sniffer, and the program promptly turned its digital nose upon all traffic flowing into and out of the server. The sniffer used this privileged position to find and extract from the data stream the key <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_stripe_card\">\"track 2\" data</a>—numbers and expiration dates, but not names—from every credit card used in store #32, saving it to a local file creatively named \"log\" for later retrieval.</p>\n<p>Suvorov didn't hack his way in, exactly—he actually had the proper credentials for the POS server. He had obtained them by hacking a bit further up the credit card food chain and breaking into servers run by Micros, maker of the POS system used at Dave &amp; Buster's. Inside the Micros system, Suvorov had found a file which he hoped would make him rich: it contained access information for POS systems deployed at Micros client locations, including Dave &amp; Buster's.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/07/hacking-dave-busters-from-your-home-in-estonia/\">Read 56 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/07/hacking-dave-busters-from-your-home-in-estonia/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/PCudN6HV4rmWk4IcPt-yr0jGEI8/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/PCudN6HV4rmWk4IcPt-yr0jGEI8/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/PCudN6HV4rmWk4IcPt-yr0jGEI8/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/PCudN6HV4rmWk4IcPt-yr0jGEI8/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/ePiEeVx-jvU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

46fad9d0-91c8-d0e9-c4e0-159c51c6cfbe.description	"<p>In <a href=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2012/09/features-perl-5-needs-in-2012.html\">Features Perl 5 Needs in 2012</a>, I suggested five mostly-not-syntax features that Perl 5 could use right now.</p>\n\n<p>The caveat to all of these features is that 1) someone must <em>code</em>\nthem and 2) someone must <em>maintain</em> them. While p5p has traditionally\ndone a lot with a little, remember that any suggestions or discussions will\nonly make it into a Perl 5 release if enough effort goes into implementation to\nmake them happen. If you want any of these features to happen, contact TPF\nabout donations or volunteer your time and skills to help (even if all you feel\ncomfortable doing is helping to refine the design of a feature, that's\nworthwhile).</p>\n\n<p>I promised to explain these features in more detail. First up is a\nmetaobject protocol for Perl 5. Stevan Little and Jesse Luehrs are working on\n<a href=\"https://github.com/stevan/p5-mop\">a proof of concept MOP for Perl\n5</a>, so this feature is well underway.</p>\n\n<p>If you're not familiar with a metaobject protocol, the book <a\nhref=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Metaobject-Protocol-Gregor-Kiczales/dp/0262610744?tag=onyneopre-20\">The\nArt of the Metaobject Protocol</a> explains everything in extensive detail.\n(It's also a pretty good book about Common Lisp, so if you're interested in a\nsemi-practical theoretical exploration of why computer sciencey things like the\nlambda calculus and well-designed extension mechanisms matter, this is a great\nbook about the design and implementation of a language.)</p>\n\n<p>If you don't want to read ~350 pages right now, the short definition of a\nMOP is <em>an API for interacting with your object system</em>. Classes (if\nyour MOP supports them) are objects. You can define a new class by making\nmethod calls. You can create objects by making method calls. You can define an\nentirely new <em>style</em> of class by creating your own new metaclass with\ndifferent behaviors. This is the reason <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Class::MOP\">Class::MOP</a> predated <a\nhref=\"http://moose.perl.org/\">Moose</a>.</p>\n\n<p>A good MOP provides a great theoretical foundation for a wonderful object\nsystem. Where many of us have defended Perl 5's object system as \"minimal but\neffective and flexible\", a good MOP in the core would let us get rid of\n<code>bless</code> in our code... and have more good features.</p>\n\n<h2>Performance Improvements</h2>\n\n<p>Moose can be slow to start, if you have lots of little classes, all on disk\nin their individual modules. Not only are you doing lots of IO to find and load\nthose classes, but you have to build up all of the classes you've defined in\nmemory through Moose's import mechanism (<code>has()</code> and\n<code>extends()</code> and <code>with()</code> are all function calls) which\ncreates and populates a metaclass behind the scenes.</p>\n\n<p>This happens every time you start your program.</p>\n\n<p>Every MooseX extension you load changes things.</p>\n\n<p>Though some of this happens in XS, where memory use can be smaller (less\nPerl data structure overhead) and speed can be faster (the same algorithm done\nin C instead of something written atop C), much of this happens at the Perl 5\nlevel.</p>\n\n<p>A great MOP could have its own custom data structures and code in the core\nto represent classes and methods and attributes, rather than Perl 5 hashes and\narrays. A great MOP could have its own ops to handle things like introspection\nand dispatch. A great MOP could have parser support to avoid the overhead of\ncalling Perl 5 functions (or crossing the XS boundary) to perform basic\nsetup.</p>\n\n<h2>Simplicity of Alternate Object Systems</h2>\n\n<p>Perl 5's default object system is very flexible for strange people like me\nwho've programmed in far too many languages (and implemented a few) who like\nvarious features of multiple languages and think \"Hey, I know, I'll implement\nthis in Perl 5.\" You bless a reference. You invoke a method. That's it.\nEverything else you can build yourself.</p>\n\n<p>The downside is that you have to figure out how to build it yourself.\nSometimes that means even diving into the source code of Perl 5 <em>itself</em>\nto see how things happen.</p>\n\n<p>A good MOP provides a foundation on which you can provide your own custom\nbehavior. As long as you hew to the protocol it defines, you can do anything\nyou want: make a custom metaclass that allows simple and protected shared\nmemory between workers, provide automatic auditing around specific methods,\nproxy transparently to remote resources, anything.</p>\n\n<p>Better yet...</p>\n\n<h2>Interoperability Between Different Object Systems</h2>\n\n<p>One of the projects I maintain uses Moose heavily. One of its dependencies\npulls in <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Moo\">Moo</a>. The authors of\nboth object systems have gone to great lengths to make sure that both work\ntogether.</p>\n\n<p>With a good MOP in place in the core, you have to go to great lengths\n<em>not to interoperate well with other object systems</em>. The default is\ninteroperability.</p>\n\n<p>(Try that in Perl 5 now, where some of the web programming or IO classes\nbless typeglobs. Oh, you expected a blessed hash? Too bad!)</p>\n\n<h2>Syntactic Improvements</h2>\n\n<p>As I alluded to earlier, a good MOP opens the door for declarative syntaxes\nfor defining classes, methods, and attributes. We might finally get a\n<code>class</code> keyword and a <code>method</code> keyword. This is very nice\nbecause it'll be faster, but also...</p>\n\n<h2>Tool Improvements</h2>\n\n<p>... language keywords the language itself knows make their way into syntax\nhighlighters and static analysis tools and reformatters and refactorers. It's\neasy to get a list of all of the methods in all of the classes in a file when\nit's unambiguous to pick out all of the names of classes in a file because you\n<em>know</em> they all have the <code>class</code> keyword in front of them,\nfor example.</p>\n\n<p>Compare that to today, where anything that looks like a coderef in a\nnamespace is potentially a method or potentially a function and the only way to\nknow is to invoke it, and why bother even trying?</p>\n\n<h2>Current Status</h2>\n\n<p>It's difficult to argue against putting a MOP in the core. Stevan and Jesse\nare working hard on it, but they could use more eyeballs on the tests and\ndesign and certainly more testing on various platforms. If you've been looking\nfor an excuse to contribute to Perl 5.18 or Perl 5.20, this is a great place to\nstart.</p>"

139fc9df-666f-146f-5c3d-b5a9d0da116f.description	"<p>I haven't written an infinite loop bug in a while. I suppose I was due. (The Greek gods always punish hubris.)</p>\n\n<p>I have a database table full of users. Let's call that table\n<code>user</code>. A user has one or more roles (from the <code>role</code>)\ntable. A user can be an unverified user, a free user, a subscriber, or an\nadministrator. (Administrators obviously are also subscribers, but you get the\npoint.)</p>\n\n<p>I use <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?DBIx::Class\">DBIx::Class</a>\nfor the database access layer. My <code>User</code> result class has a couple\nof methods which let other model actions query whether the user can perform\nspecific operations. They're <a\nhref=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2011/05/decoupling-testability-and-synthetic-attributes.html\">synthetic\nattributes</a>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>has [<span class=\"Constant\">qw(</span><span class=\"Constant\"> is_admin is_subscriber </span><span class=\"Constant\">)</span>], <span class=\"Constant\">is</span> =&gt; <span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">ro</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span>, <span class=\"Constant\">lazy_build</span> =&gt; <span class=\"Constant\">1</span>;\n\n<span class=\"Statement\">sub </span><span class=\"Identifier\">_build_is_admin      </span>{ <span class=\"Statement\">shift</span>-&gt;find_role_by_name( <span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">admin</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span>      ) }\n<span class=\"Statement\">sub </span><span class=\"Identifier\">_build_is_subscriber </span>{ <span class=\"Statement\">shift</span>-&gt;find_role_by_name( <span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">subscriber</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span> ) }</code></pre>\n\n<p>Obviously the implementation of <code>find_role_by_name()</code> is\nsupremely important. Here's how I originally wrote the code (no sense blaming\nanyone else for this, because <em>I</em> wrote all of the access control code\nmyself.) See if you can catch the bug:</p>\n\n<pre><code><span class=\"Statement\">sub </span><span class=\"Identifier\">find_role_by_name</span>\n{\n    <span class=\"Statement\">my</span> (<span class=\"Identifier\">$self</span>, <span class=\"Identifier\">$name</span>) = <span class=\"Identifier\">@_</span>;\n\n    <span class=\"Statement\">while</span> (<span class=\"Statement\">my</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$role</span> = <span class=\"Identifier\">$self</span><span class=\"Identifier\">-&gt;user_roles-&gt;next</span>)\n    {\n        <span class=\"Statement\">return</span> <span class=\"Constant\">1</span> <span class=\"Statement\">if</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$role</span><span class=\"Identifier\">-&gt;role-&gt;name</span> <span class=\"Statement\">eq</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$name</span>;\n    }\n\n    <span class=\"Statement\">return</span> <span class=\"Constant\">0</span>;\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>As a hint, the <code>user_roles</code> method represents the relationship\nbetween the <code>user</code> table and the <code>role</code> table. That\nmethod returns a DBIC resultset which represents the entries in the table with\na foreign key to the <code>user</code> table.</p>\n\n<p>See the bug yet? It took me a while. The problem is that <em>every\ninvocation of the loop</em> fetches a new resultset. Every invocation of the\nloop fetches only the <em>first</em> result from that resultset.</p>\n\n<p>My tests (yeah, I wrote the tests too, before I wrote this code in fact,\njust like you're supposed to do) didn't catch that because the rest of the code\nonly ever checked for one user role, the administrator role, anywhere else.\nOnly when I added code for the subscriber role did the subscription tests\ntrigger this infinite loop. (Now how abhorred in my imagination is that most\nexcellent jest!)</p>\n\n<p>I wish I could say that I diagnosed the cause immediately. I didn't. I\nstared at the code for far too long, until I had the presence of mind to put a\ndebugging statement in the loop body to print the name of the role.  (Stat\nofficium pristina nomine.)</p>\n\n<p>Here's the corrected code, with a single expression hoisted into a scalar\nvariable where it may endure properly:</p>\n\n<pre><code><span class=\"Statement\">sub </span><span class=\"Identifier\">find_role_by_name</span>\n{\n    <span class=\"Statement\">my</span> (<span class=\"Identifier\">$self</span>, <span class=\"Identifier\">$name</span>) = <span class=\"Identifier\">@_</span>;\n    <span class=\"Statement\">my</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$user_roles_rs</span> = <span class=\"Identifier\">$self</span><span class=\"Identifier\">-&gt;user_roles</span>;\n\n    <span class=\"Statement\">while</span> (<span class=\"Statement\">my</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$role</span> = <span class=\"Identifier\">$user_roles_rs</span><span class=\"Identifier\">-&gt;next</span>)\n    {\n        <span class=\"Statement\">return</span> <span class=\"Constant\">1</span> <span class=\"Statement\">if</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$role</span><span class=\"Identifier\">-&gt;role-&gt;name</span> <span class=\"Statement\">eq</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$name</span>;\n    }\n\n    <span class=\"Statement\">return</span> <span class=\"Constant\">0</span>;\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>I will say this: expecting your test suite to pass in under 30 seconds makes this sort of thing much easier to catch. If I'd had to wait for a continuous integration server to get around to checking this commit, I wouldn't have fixed it as quickly as I did.</p>\n\n<p>Then again, it's easier to debug bugs you never write in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>Oh, and if you catch the literary allusion in the title, here's your prize:\ncongratulations! You might be overeducated. (If you caught the other three\nallusions, have you ever noticed how much Pynchon's <em>V</em> influenced\nStephenson's <em>Cryptonomicon</em>?)</p>"

Consider\ntypical Moose code:</p>\n\n<pre><code><span class=\"Statement\">package</span><span class=\"Type\"> MyApp::App::Role::HasMailer</span>;\n<span class=\"Comment\"># ABSTRACT: role which provides other app roles with a mailer</span>\n\n<span class=\"Statement\">use </span>Modern::Perl;\n<span class=\"Statement\">use </span>Moose::Role;\n\n<span class=\"Statement\">use </span>MyApp::Mailer;\n\nhas <span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">mailer</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span>, <span class=\"Constant\">is</span> =&gt; <span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">ro</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span>, <span class=\"Constant\">lazy_build</span> =&gt; <span class=\"Constant\">1</span>;\n\n<span class=\"Statement\">sub </span><span class=\"Identifier\">_build_mailer</span>\n{\n    <span class=\"Statement\">my</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$self</span>        = <span class=\"Statement\">shift</span>;\n    <span class=\"Statement\">my</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$config</span>      = <span class=\"Statement\">do</span> <span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">myapp_local.pl</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span>;\n    <span class=\"Statement\">my</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$mail_client</span> = <span class=\"Identifier\">$config-&gt;{</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">Model::UserMail</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Identifier\">}</span><span class=\"Identifier\">{</span><span class=\"Constant\">mail_client</span><span class=\"Identifier\">}</span>;\n    <span class=\"Statement\">return</span> MyApp::Mailer-&gt;new( <span class=\"Identifier\">$mail_client</span> );\n}\n\n<span class=\"Constant\">1</span>;</code></pre>\n\n<p>... where functions such as <code>has</code> and <code>with</code> and\n<code>extends</code> look like declarations (such as <code>my</code> and\n<code>sub</code>), but are actually code to run.</p>\n\n<p>The difference is important. A declaration that's part of the language's\ngrammar need only be <em>parsed</em> to have its effects take place, while a\nstatement or expression needs to <em>run</em> to take place.</p>\n\n<p>This is, of course, why variable declarations makes lexical scoping trivial\nto understand for experienced Perl programmers, why binding closures to their\nlexical environments is easy in the simple cases, and why binding closures to\ntheir lexical environments when you use the STRING form of <code>eval</code> is\nso difficult.</p>\n\n<p>As Moose hackers will tell you, Moose isn't a simple preprocessor you run\nover your code once to generate <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Moose::Manual::Unsweetened\">longer, uglier\ncode without syntactic goodness</a>. Instead, <a\nhref=\"http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=685459\">classes are built, not\ndeclared</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This is endemic to Moose, but it's not a characteristic specific to Modern\nPerl. It's inherent in Perl 5 itself, even the 1994 version. <a\nhref=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2009/08/how-a-perl-5-program-works.html\">Perl\n5 lets you run arbitrary code while parsing happens</a>.</p>\n\n<p>While you can gain tremendous flexibility with this approach (building up\nclosures with partially applied arguments to export to caller namespaces), you\ncan't serialize the resulting code as easily because you may have to run\narbitrary code to restore your program in memory.</p>\n\n<p>Put another way, <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Exporter\">Exporter</a> is a library while\nit should be core language behavior.</p>\n\n<p>In the simple case where a library wants to export a couple of symbols into\nthe caller's namespace, say <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> from <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?List::Util\">List::Util</a>, why is there\nno simple syntax for marking those symbols as exportable in\n<code>List::Util</code> without having to run code (or worse yet, <em>inherit\nfrom</em>) <code>Exporter</code>?</p>\n\n<p>If a declarative syntax existed&mdash;with language support or at least the\nbroad consistency to allow for tool support&mdash;such that it were statically\npossible to determine the symbols exported from one package and imported into\nanother package, precompilation would be easier. A module could have a static\nlist of exports provided in a manifest of sorts. (A good optimizer could even\ndecline to import unused code!)</p>\n\n<p>I realize it isn't always possible to reduce all cases of exporting to a\nlist of static symbols (nor is it desirable to remove that power), but at least\n80% of the code I write would benefit from this. We'd also be able to have\nbetter tool support for the language; it would be easier to discover which\nsymbols come from where, and we might even close the \"You can't always tell\nwhich of two interpretations of a parse tree is valid in Perl 5 code thanks to\n<code>import</code> and <code>BEGIN</code>\" gap a little further.</p>\n\n<p>(... but then someone will ask why <code>strict</code> is a pragma and not\ncore language behavior, especially after looking at its implementation, and\nthen we'll all go to the paint store to pick out our favorite colors. See also \"I didn't provide an example of this declarative syntax, so you can't argue about it in the comments.\")</p>"

0739a72b-0206-d898-20ef-a6bb27f9f7c5.description	"<p>One of my work projects has a test suite that's grown a little too slow for\nmy liking. With only a few hundred tests, I've seen our test runs take over 30\nseconds in a couple of cases. We're diligent about separating tests into\nindividual logical files, so that when we work on a feature we can run only its\ntests as we develop and save running the whole suite for the last verification\nbefore checkin, but 30 seconds is still too long.</p>\n\n<p>(Before you ask, <a\nhref=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2011/11/parallelism-and-test-suites.html\">our\ntest suite is fully parallelizable</a>, so that 30 seconds keeps all of the\ncores on a development box at full usage.)</p>\n\n<p>I realize that one fad in software of the last few years is continuous\nintegration, where you submit your commits to a box somewhere for that to run\nthe full test suite and email you if something goes wrong, sometime in the\nfuture, hopefully less than an hour from now. Hopefully.</p>\n\n<p>We can't afford to wait that long to know if our code is right. (I like to\npush to our production box as soon as we have well-tested fixes that we know\nwork reliably. That's often more than once per day. I'm the only one working on\nthe site today, and I've already pushed three changes, with at least one more\ncoming.)</p>\n\n<p>When I worked on <a href=\"http://parrotcode.org/\">Parrot</a>, I spent a lot\nof time profiling the VM to sneak out small performance improvements here and\nthere, using less memory and far fewer CPU cycles. I'm at home in a profiler,\nso I picked a very small test program and ran it through <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Devel::NYTProf\">Devel::NYTProf</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I've mentioned before that this application has a <a\nhref=\"http://catalystframework.org/\">Catalyst</a> frontend which takes full\nadvantage of <a href=\"http://moose.perl.org/\">Moose</a> throughout. It uses <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?DBIx::Class\">DBIx::Class</a> as its\npersistence layer.</p>\n\n<p>As you might expect, <em>startup</em> time dominates most of the tests. We\nhave 21 individual test files, and startup took close to two seconds for each\nof them. No matter how much we parallelized, we were always going to spend no\nless than 40 total seconds running tests. (The non-parallel test suite runs in\n~67 seconds, so parallelization already gives a 55% improvement.)</p>\n\n<p>When I looked at the profile, I saw that most of the startup time came from\na couple of dependencies we didn't need.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, even though I use <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?HTML::FormHandler\">HTML::FormHandler</a>\nquite happily on another project, we don't use it on this project at all. We\ndid use a Catalyst plugin which brought it in as a dependency, but we never\nused that feature.</p>\n\n<p>I spent an hour revising that part of our application to remove that plugin\n(which we used to use, then customized our code so that the plugin was almost\nvestigial) and the parallel test run went down to 23 seconds.</p>\n\n<p>We trimmed 10% of our dependencies, just by removing one plugin and the code\nit brought in.</p>\n\n<p>(Tip: use <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Devel::TraceUse\">Devel::TraceUse</a> to\nfind out which modules load which modules. It's a good way to get the\nconceptual weight of a dependency.)</p>\n\n<p>I don't shy away from dependencies when they're useful, but I ended up\nrevising one file and ending up with <em>less</em> code overall than we had\nbefore I started.</p>\n\n<p>With that said, there's clearly room for improvement. I traced through some\nMoose code which handles initialization (especially of attributes) and it seems\nlike there should be some efficiency gains there. Similarly, both Catalyst and\nDBIC go through some contortions to load plugins and components that in my case\nwere unnecessary. (I have a patch to consider for the former, but not the\nlatter.)</p>\n\n<p>Two things I learned do bother me somewhat. If you use\n<code>Devel::TraceUse</code> on a project of any size, you'll see a lot of\ninconsistency and duplication, thanks to years of TIMTOWTDI. Catalyst brings in\nMoose, but DBIC eventually ends up bringing in <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Moo\">Moo</a>. No one can decide whether to\nuse <code>@ISA</code> or <code>use base '...';</code> or <code>use parent\n'...';</code>. A lot of larger projects (DateTime, Moose extensions) have lots\nof helper modules spread out in lots of tiny <em>.pm</em> files which each need\nto be located, loaded, and compiled.</p>\n\n<p>Worse, all of the nice declarative syntax you get with some of these modern\nlibraries has a cost behind the scenes every time you run the program <em>even\nif nothing has changed</em>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=990666\">If I were to pick an\noptimization target for future versions of Perl 5</a>, I'd want a good way for\nMoose or Catalyst or whatever to precompile my nice sugared code into a cached\nrepresentation that could then load faster on subsequent invocations. (I know\nyou're not getting an order of magnitude improvement here: you still have to\nset up stubs for metaclasses and the like, but even getting attributes and\nmethods in place would be an improvement!)</p>\n\n<p>I'd settle today for a preforking test suite that doesn't require me to\nrewrite all of my tests.</p>\n\n<p>Then again, that ~25% improvement in test execution from removing one\ndependency isn't bad for the week either.</p>"

21f940c2-6e88-47e8-8dc1-fb0c16cabf2f.description	"<p>Today is Alan Turing&#8217;s 100th birthday. I&#8217;ve been thinking about him lately, in particular about a story that demonstrates the perils of working with genius.</p>\n<p>The story goes that, when Turing was working with the Manchester Baby (the first stored program computer ever built. Just) a colleague wrote the first ever assembler which would turn (relatively) human readable assembly language and turn it into the ones and zeroes of machine code that the machine could actually execute. He showed it to Turing, who blew up at him, ranting that using the computer to do &#8216;trivial&#8217; jobs like that were a massive waste of expensive computer time.</p>\n<p>The problem with working with a genius, from the point of view of more ordinary mortals, is that the genius has only a very rough idea of what is actually easy, and what is only easy to them. From today&#8217;s vantage point, when computers are as freely available as they are now, the idea of <em>not</em> letting the computer do the shitwork for you seems utterly ludicrous &#8211; programmer time is more valuable than computer time.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s less obvious is that the same was true in Turing&#8217;s time (when there was precisely one computer) too. It only takes one programmer to make a mistake in translating from assembler to machine code and run a job that, for instance, gets stuck in an infinite loop and you&#8217;ve probably wasted more computer time (and programmer time) than if you&#8217;d just run it through the assembler in the first place. Turing didn&#8217;t see that, because the process of translating from symbols to binary wasn&#8217;t something that he found particularly complicated. To him, what was needed wasn&#8217;t more and better tools, it was more and better Turings.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not entirely sure that I believe the story (and I can&#8217;t remember where I heard it, so it may be a phantom of my memory). It certainly doesn&#8217;t chime with the Turing who was instrumental in mechanising the shitwork of finding the days rotor settings so that Enigma traffic could be cracked. The history of Bletchley Park is a story of building better and better machines to do the dully repetitive jobs that humans find so hard to stick to and which machines excel at.</p>\n<p>The &#8220;Just write code without bugs in the first place&#8221; school of programming is alive and well today. It&#8217;s not my school though. I&#8217;m very much an exploratory coder. I like to have tests to show me the way and to keep me honest so that I don&#8217;t go breaking things when I change this bit here. I&#8217;ve customised my editing environment to help me as much as possible. I have a nasty habit of writing bare words that I should have quoted, so I have a keystroke that shoves the last word into quotes for me. Another keystroke will align all the broad arrows at the current level of nesting. I&#8217;ve got snippets set up that fill in standard boilerplate when I start a new class, a huge list of common spelling mistakes that get autocorrected while I&#8217;m not looking and an expanding list of other little helpers that I need to write when I get around to it. Automation lets me go faster, make more and better mistakes and recover from them faster. I am a of little brain and I want all the help I can give myself.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure that Turing would be in the same camp as me.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the thing though &#8211; Turing was, definitely, a genius. But his paper &#8220;On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem&#8221; (the one that gave the world the Turing Machine) has a bug in it. In fact, it has two. The first is obvious enough that I spotted it when i read the paper for the first time. The second bug is rather more subtle (but still fixable. It&#8217;s okay, the field of computing is not build on sand).</p>\n<p>I love that The Paper &#8211; The one that&#8217;s the theoretical basis for the modern world (first publishd 75 years ago, round(ish) number fans) &#8211; has a bug. It gives me a strange kind of hope. Fallibility gets us all &#8211; even people who have saved the world. I think we should celebrate the humanity as well as the genius. Turing was, by all accounts, a very odd fish, but the world is undeniably richer for his contributions.</p>\n<p>So, let&#8217;s raise a glass to the memory of Alan Turing tonight, marathon runner, gay icon, saviour of the world and the pleasantly fallible inventor of the modern world. Not a bad CV, when you think about it.</p>\n<h4>Updated</h4>\n<p>Apparently I&#8217;m wrong about it being Turing who didn&#8217;t like the assembler but Von Neumann (another genius). See below for details. And phew! How nice to find that a hero doesn&#8217;t have feet of clay.</p>"

It just so happened that <span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span> (Yet Another Perl Conference) was held in Asheville this year, the week before the gathering&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.swangathering.com/Catalog/TS/sgtssched.html\">Traditional Song Week</a>. Well, I&#8217;m a perl hacker. I sing traditional songs. My employer was paying for me to attend <span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span> and were willing for me to extend my stay in America by a week. It was a no brainer really.</p>\n<p><span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span> was bloody good this year. Perl 5 development is moving forward and the community is buzzing because of it. Lots of &#8220;… and we&#8217;re hiring&#8221; slides. And that&#8217;s before we get to the pleasure of catching up with friends that I only see online most of the time. If you&#8217;re working in any field that has grassroots conferences associated with it, I can&#8217;t recommend attending them highly enough.</p>\n<h3>On to Swannanoa</h3>\n<p>At Swannanoa, I met Sheila Kay Adams and immediately switched my schedule to spend as much time singing with her as possible. Sheila&#8217;s a seventh generation ballad singer from the Sodom Laurel community in Madison Count. Her &#8220;grannie Berzil&#8221; Wallin remembered Cecil Sharp coming to Madison County and collecting songs from the family.</p>\n<p>Pedigree in singing shouldn&#8217;t matter, but it turns out it does. Sheila grew up in a community which was changing, but which still had old &#8216;love songs&#8217; as an important part of how it understood the world. Today, not so much. People still relate to the world and understand it through songs, but the songs are more likely to be contemporary. Lyrically, many of the love songs that Sheila and her family sing could have been written yesterday, but their performance is radically different from contemporary style. One voice, unaccompanied, a style that requires the listener to concentrate on the song rather than any aspects of production. Not something you&#8217;re going to dance to at your wedding, say.</p>\n<p>Sheila&#8217;s classes, on Meeting House Songs (more later) and her Ballads class with Bobbie McMillon were just wonderful; I won&#8217;t forget in a hurry the sound Bobbie singing &#8220;A conversation with Death&#8221; as a thunderstorm grumbled across the campus in the background. Spine tingling stuff. Sheila&#8217;s description of how she learned songs &#8220;knee to knee&#8221; has been helpful too. The way it would work was that the teacher and student would be sat out on the porch, often doing some chore or another, and the teacher would sing the first verse of a song. The student would sing it back and the teacher would sing the second verse. The student would then sing the first two verses then the teacher would sing the third verse and the student would sing the first three verses and so on, until the student was singing the whole song back to the teacher. A time consuming process to be sure, but it works.</p>\n<p>I know this because I learned Pretty Saro from a recording of Sheila&#8217;s late husband Jim Taylor, using a variant of the method, &#8220;knee to CD&#8221; if you like. I&#8217;d play the first verse, hit pause and sing it back, play the second verse, pause, repeat the first two… and so on. And in very short order I had the words and tune (up to a point; I listened back to that recording again recently and I&#8217;m singing a different tune now) and could start the process of actually <em>learning</em> the song, which involved singing it it lots, listening to other recordings, singing it some more and then taking the song out and trying it out in front of audiences and listening to what works and what doesn&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve never really finished learning a song; this recording is a snapshot. I hope you enjoy it.</p>"

98a60f8f-a6e7-9d54-a937-6a1d6ae16a9d.description	"<p>I sometimes think that I should have published the lyrics to <a href=\"http://www.bofh.org.uk/child-of-the-library\">Child of the Library</a> with a bibliography. The references in the second verse are all obvious to me, but I&#8217;m a white middle class English boy who grew up around boats. My childhood reading and yours may not intersect all that much.</p>\n<p>So&#8230;</p>\n<h4>The Walkers and the Blacketts</h4>\n<p>Also known as the <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=intitle:%22Swallows+and+Amazons%22\">Swallows and Amazons.</a> <cite>Swallows and Amazons</cite> is the first &#8216;big&#8217; book that I can remember reading for myself. We were in Cornwall, holidaying at the same place my mum&#8217;s been going to since she was a kid. Mum was reading <cite>Swallows and Amazons</cite> to us, and it was great, but I was impatient to find out what happened next, so I took the book to bed with me and read it for myself. I haven&#8217;t stopped yet. <cite>Swallows and Amazons</cite> was the book that opened my door to reading for pleasure. It opened up a way of looking at the world too. I can&#8217;t imagine who I&#8217;d be if I&#8217;d never read any Ransome.</p>\n<h4>The Pevensies</h4>\n<p>The Pevensies are the family in <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=intitle:%22The+Lion+The+Witch+And+The+Wardrobe%22\">The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe,</a> the first of the Narnia books. I have a slightly troubled relationship with these books now. I <em>really</em> don&#8217;t get on with C. S. Lewis&#8217;s view of the world (I once hurled a taped reading of <cite>The Screwtape Letters</cite> out of the car rather than listen to another word of the bloody things), but I wasn&#8217;t reading between the lines when I was nine. I was just loving the stories and the images they put in my head. And what images&#8230;</p>\n<h4>Simp, the Canine Cannonball</h4>\n<p>What do you mean, you&#8217;ve never read <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=intitle:%22Cannonball+Simp%22\">Cannonball Simp?</a> You poor thing!</p>\n<p><cite>Cannonball Simp</cite>, by John Burningham is <em>the</em> library book for me. Back when I was 4 or 5, I would walk with my dad from Regent&#8217;s Square to the Doncaster Central Library every Saturday morning, with three books clutched under my arm. I&#8217;d hand them over the counter, receiving in exchange 3 buff cardboard library slip holders. I would then go over to the childrens&#8217; books section and pull out three new (to me) books and take them to the counter. The librarian would remove the slip from the library bookplate, place it in one of my surrendered holders and stamp the slip and the bookplate with the date, three weeks hence, by which the book must be renewed.</p>\n<p>Well, that&#8217;s how it worked until weekend I came back with <cite>Cannonball Simp</cite>. I <em>loved</em> it. I didn&#8217;t want to take it back because I hadn&#8217;t learned it yet. Sure I could &#8216;read&#8217; along with Dad &#8211; I knew all the words by then &#8211; but the pictures were another thing entirely. They were <em>beautiful</em>. They still are.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s when I learned of the magic of &#8216;renewal&#8217;. Instead of handing the book back, I showed it to the librarian and said &#8220;I&#8217;d like to renew this, please,&#8221; and instead of giving me my library card back, they just stamped the book and slip with a new date. Wow! It was like I <em>owned</em> the book.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know how many times I renewed that book. I&#8217;m afraid I don&#8217;t remember the words any more. But I still remember the pleasure that it gave me.</p>\n<h4>Galadriel the Fair</h4>\n<p>On the last day of junior school our form teacher, Miss Rees, wrote a long list of books on the board and asked us to copy the list into the back of our exercise books. She said that these were books we should try and read. I don&#8217;t have the exercise book any more and I remember very little of the list. I do remember that I&#8217;d already read some of them. And I remember <cite>The Hobbit</cite> and <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=intitle:%22The+Lord+of+the+Rings%22\">The Lord of the Rings</a>. Oh boy, do I remember <cite>The Hobbit</cite> and <cite>The Lord of the Rings</cite>.</p>\n<p>Terry Pratchett said that if you&#8217;re a 14 year old boy and you don&#8217;t think that The Lord of the Rings is the best book ever written then there may be something wrong with you, but if you&#8217;re 28 and you <em>still</em> think it&#8217;s the best book ever written then there&#8217;s <em>definitely</em> something wrong with you. I <em>was</em> that 14 year old boy. I stayed up all night reading it. I fell asleep reading it. I read the appendices. I worked out how to write my name in Elvish script. I even read <cite>The Silmarillion</cite> and thought I enjoyed it. I can still recite some of the poetry. In Elvish. I&#8217;ve forgotten the words of Cannonball Simp, but get me going with &#8220;A Elbereth Gilthoniel&#8230;&#8221; and I can just about reel off the rest of the poem. What&#8217;s wrong with me?</p>\n<p>By the time I was 28, LotR wasn&#8217;t the best book ever written. I&#8217;m no longer sure that there is such a thing as &#8220;The Best Book Ever Written&#8221;. Still, if you haven&#8217;t at least read <cite>The Hobbit</cite> you should take steps to rectify matters. Or wait for the Peter Jackson movie.</p>\n<h4>The Daughter of a Pirate King</h4>\n<p>Confession time: I haven&#8217;t read <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=intitle:%22Pippi+Longstocking%22\">Pippi Longstocking</a>. The &#8216;I&#8217; of <cite>A Child of the Library</cite> is a composite of Gill and me. <cite>Pippi Longstocking</cite> was her Nancy Blackett. The  <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=Bastable+inauthor:Nesbit\">Bastables</a> were her Pevensies.</p>\n<h4>Paddington the Bear</h4>\n<p>Once I&#8217;d learned that reading for myself was pure pleasure, I read anything and everything I could find in the library and I discovered Michael Bond&#8217;s <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=intitle:Paddington+inauthor:%22Michael+Bond%22\">Paddington Bear</a>. Paddington was a well meaning young bear from Peru who was found, wearing a duffel coat and a label reading &#8220;Please look after this bear&#8221;, at Paddington Station by the Brown Family. The Browns took him in immediately, named him Paddington after the station and&#8230; &#8216;hijinks ensue&#8217;.</p>\n<p>I would be quietly reading these books to myself when some episode or another (&#8220;Baked Elastic&#8221;; the Russian ballet dancer; the wobbly table&#8230;) would cause me to laugh out loud and my brother would demand to know what was funny and made me read whatever it was aloud to him. I have to confess, I resented this, but not enough to dent my enjoyment. The Paddington books are made of joy.</p>"

ce4bd83d-a131-a291-3582-168632f29bd7.description	"<p>Or… what I did this summer.</p>\n<p>Summer as been frantic. Mostly joyous, but frantic.</p>\n<p>I had talks accepted at both <a href=\"http://www.yapc2011.us/yn2011/\"><span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span></a> and <a href=\"http://oscon.com/\"><span class=\"caps\">OSCON</span></a>. Because <span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span> was in Asheville, and the <a href=\"http://www.swangathering.com/\">Swannanoa Gathering</a> Traditional Song Week fell the week after <span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span>, that meant I flew out to Asheville for an intense fortnight of Perl community engagement followed by a week spent singing myself hoarse and being blown away by <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/sheilakayadams\">Sheila Kay Adams&#8217;s</a> singing and her stories of mountain life and listening to future stars like <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/sheilakayadams\">Sam Gleaves</a> and inspiring activists like <a href=\"http://www.blairpathways.com/\">Saro Lynch Thomason</a>. I could write entire posts on every one of those, and that&#8217;s before I get on to the magic of watching the sun go down and the fireflies come up from the grass of the Warren Wilson College&#8217;s natural amphitheatre. Magical so it was.</p>\n<p>On the last night of the gathering, there was a student showcase. Of course, I sang <a href=\"http://www.bofh.org.uk/child-of-the-library\">Child of the Library</a>. Rather embarrassingly, I skipped a verse, but the response was great. Several people came up to me afterwards and told me their library stories and, I hope, went home with a determination to help protect their libraries.</p>\n<p>Then it was back to the UK for a fortnight before heading off again to <span class=\"caps\">OSCON</span> in Portland, OR. I was down to give two talks, one on <a href=\"http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011/public/schedule/detail/17872\">Higher Order Javascript</a> and a second on <a href=\"http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011/public/schedule/detail/18577\">Polymorphic Dispatch</a> which proved to be a bear to write. I&#8217;d planned to have everything done and dusted and the slides learned by the time I flew out, but spent a huge amount of time blocked on how I was going to present the ideas using a motivating problem that hit the sweet spot between too simple and too complicated. It wasn&#8217;t until I arrived in Portland and talked things through with my host, <a href=\"http://www.justatheory.com/\">David Wheeler</a>, that I got that worked out. The slides were written in a tearing rush and weren&#8217;t as good as I would like them to be. I still owe the talk attendees a full writeup, so I&#8217;ll take this opportunity to apologise for the lateness and promise that a writeup <em>will</em> arrive. The Javascript talk was based on one I&#8217;ve given before, but I&#8217;m starting to realise that it&#8217;s a full tutorial masquerading as a short talk. More on that later, I hope.</p>\n<p>What with flapping about the unwritten talk, and the 10 minute gap between them, I didn&#8217;t really worry overmuch about the Perl lightning talks. It&#8217;s been my practice to sing a lightly massaged version of <a href=\"http://LOUANDPETER.COM/\">Lou and Peter Berryman&#8217;s</a> very splendid song <cite>A Chat With Your Mother</cite> with tailored verses about different language communities and various Perl luminaries. I <em>had</em> decided to retire it, but at <span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span> I came up with a snide verse about myself and another about Larry Wall, so it felt renewed enough to be worth singing this year as well. I ended up singing Child of the Library again.</p>\n<p>The response was phenomenal. I&#8217;ve been singing it for long enough now that I know it <em>gets</em> people. Hell, when I was writing it, there were verses that were hard to sing because they got me and I was choking up as I tried to sing them. But the lightning talk got a standing ovation. Again people were telling me library stories and I found that the UK isn&#8217;t the only country with local governments stupid enough to consider closing libraries, it was happening in the US too. So, fired up by that response, I went to see Sarah Novotny and begged her for five minutes on the <span class=\"caps\">OSCON</span> stage before the closing keynote. Bless her, she let me have it.</p>\n<h3>Pics, or it didn&#8217;t happen!</h3>\n<p>I have proof too! The main stage at O&#8217;Reilly events has serious video equipment pointed at it. Because it&#8217;s important that people get to see serious talks about <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnX5v0uwNjc&amp;list=PL93FC98105B19725C&amp;index=39&amp;feature=plpp\">known bugs and exploits in wetware</a>. Because my performance wasn&#8217;t on the schedule, and I didn&#8217;t have a video release all signed and ready to go beforehand, it&#8217;s taken a while to get the video available. But last night, that changed, so here I am, in all my corpulent glory. Enjoy. And please, spread this video as far and as wide as you can. Libraries are important.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"345\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/MDi5JtS1H-g\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>"

This happens as I sing  it out to different audiences and find out which bits work, which bits are hard to sing and all the other little details that you only find out when there&#8217;s a living, breathing, listening and (hopefully) singing audience in front of you.</p>\n<p>It turns out that the same things happens with songs I&#8217;ve written.</p>\n<p>The biggest stumbling block of the original version is the last line of the first verse:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My wife met Pippi Langstumpf, I met Paddington the Bear</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Someone on the comment thread suggested:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Heidi, Pippi Longstocking and Paddington the Bear</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which is fine, except that means singing &#8216;PIPpi LONGstockING&#8217;, and I&#8217;m not happy with putting the emphasis on the <span class=\"caps\">WRONG</span> sylLABles if I can possibly help it. In the revised version, I think I&#8217;ve cracked it. The line is now:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The daughter of a pirate king and Paddington the bear</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which is <em>much</em> easier to sing and follows the rest of the verse by being a more oblique reference to the character. If you know who Pippi is, then it&#8217;s obvious who I&#8217;m singing about. If you don&#8217;t, then maybe I&#8217;ve piqued your curiosity.</p>\n<p>The first recording also had two slightly different tunes for the verses, this version has settled on just the one.</p>\n<p>And, for people who care about that sort of thing, this was recorded with a click track at 110bpm rather than speeding up over the course of the song, which should make life a little easier for anyone taking part in Rabid Gravy&#8217;s <a href=\"http://blog.rabidgravy.com/making-music-to-save-our-libraries\">project</a> to remix and rerecord different versions of the song.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re concerned about Library closures, a good place to start is <a href=\"http://www.voicesforthelibrary.org.uk/\">Voices for the Library</a>. If you&#8217;re on twitter, you might also start following <a href=\"http://twitter.com/ukpling\">@ukpling</a>. If you&#8217;re not concerned about library closures, why on earth did you read this far, and what kind of excuse for a human being are you?</p>"

Frankly, instrumentation scares me, I&#8217;m much happier singing unaccompanied but I realise I&#8217;m in a minority on this.</p>\n<p>When you sing it, try making the song your own by changing things to suit your own. Julie Chilton&#8217;s posted an alternate first verse in the comments, but the world is the mollusc of your choice.</p>\n<p>The &#8216;I&#8217; in the song, isn&#8217;t <em>quite</em> me and it isn&#8217;t quite Gill either. Most importantly, both of us grew up in houses where no book was out of bounds. Our fathers used to take us to our respective local libraries (Lewisham for Gill, Doncaster Central and then Bawtry for me) every week or so on a Saturday morning. As soon as I was old enough, I&#8217;d ride my bike from our home in Scrooby to Bawtry with a carrier full of books hanging off the handlebars. Bawtry is currently in the crosshairs of Doncaster&#8217;s idiot mayor &#8211; the bloke who suggested getting kindles for everyone instead &#8211; along with 13 other libraries in the district.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a revised version of the recording with additional notes at: http://www.bofh.org.uk/2011/04/04/a-child-of-the-library-revised, or just press play:</p>\n<p><object height=\"81\" width=\"100%\"> <param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F13031396\"></param> <param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param> <embed allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"81\" src=\"http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F13031396\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed> </object>  <span><a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/pdcawley/child-of-the-library-revised\">Child Of The Library (Revised)</a> by <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/pdcawley\">pdcawley</a></span></p>\n<h5>August 9th 2011</h5>\n<p>I&#8217;ve updated the lyrics here to reflect what I sing now.

Somehow there are companies out there selling very high end, and \"provably secure\" cryptography gear, all based on fundamental principles of quantum mechanics. Yet, despite being <em>fundamentally</em> unbreakable, there have been quite a few publications on more-or-less practical ways for Eve to eavesdrop on people whispering quantum sweet-nothings in darkened rooms.</p>\n<p>As a bemused onlooker, I jumped on the TGV train from Paris to journey to the heart of quantum key distribution (QKD): Geneva. Geneva is where QKD was deployed in real-world demonstrations, it is the base of Id Quantique, a company that specializes in quantum physics based security products, and it is home to University of Geneva's <em>GAP-Optique</em>, a power house of quantum optics research.</p>\n<p>My goal was to discover what all the fuss was about. Who buys a QKD distribution system? Why do they bother? If QKD becomes ubiquitous, where is the battle between white and black hats going to be played out, and how will that battle change? What is the future of QKD research?</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/09/quantum-cryptography-yesterday-today-and-tomorrow/\">Read 91 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/09/quantum-cryptography-yesterday-today-and-tomorrow/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/Hm8Da6yqCUUNpqUDpkmfk6_Vgi8/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/Hm8Da6yqCUUNpqUDpkmfk6_Vgi8/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/Hm8Da6yqCUUNpqUDpkmfk6_Vgi8/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/Hm8Da6yqCUUNpqUDpkmfk6_Vgi8/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/Ls5uZSncw6U\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

Originally started as a small gathering of Dungeons &amp; Dragons co-creator Gary Gygax’s friends, GenCon now finds itself the capstone event amidst a kind of golden age for so-called hobby games. Board gamers, role-playing gamers, LARPers, and war gamers all sit shoulder to shoulder in its massive play spaces, while buskers vie for their attention on the nearly 400-strong vendor floor. Boosted by satellite events like PAX and the un-closeting of an emboldened gamer population at large, there’s plenty of room for continued growth.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">Buried inside the sacred tome that is GenCon’s annual program, amidst the thousands of play sessions of new and old properties, was a listing for an entirely new event—a keynote presentation. To no one’s surprise, the keynote presentation was given by Wizards of the Coast (WotC). Their goal? To rally the faithful around their grand experiment called \"D&amp;D Next.\"</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">The time of troubles</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">The Dungeons &amp; Dragons family of games has been in and out of a state of civil war throughout its history. Call them “The Edition Wars.” OD&amp;D begat AD&amp;D which begat Third Edition, and with each transition came, if not enmity within the ranks, then perhaps the kind of gentle chiding that siblings have for one another across the dinner table. But nothing ruined Thanksgiving quite like the row that developed over the release of Dungeons &amp; Dragons Fourth Edition, colloquially known as D&amp;D 4e.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/09/getting-back-to-the-story-hands-on-with-dungeons-dragons-next/\">Read 27 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/09/getting-back-to-the-story-hands-on-with-dungeons-dragons-next/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/IjyOG5Vw2xSncJG_esEnIyBuOFI/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/IjyOG5Vw2xSncJG_esEnIyBuOFI/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/IjyOG5Vw2xSncJG_esEnIyBuOFI/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/IjyOG5Vw2xSncJG_esEnIyBuOFI/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/Iia7rbYaslk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

This seems easy at first. When the game begins, you invariably find yourself on a sandy beach somewhere, and a bit of experimentation quickly yields the knowledge that you can affect your environment by punching things. You can punch trees to break them apart and collect wood, for instance, which you can use to make tools, which you can use to gather more materials, which you can use to make more things. You'll just be getting the hang of the basic mechanics when night falls—and the zombies and skeletons and spiders and creepers come out to collect your soul.</p>\n<p>As the game grew more popular, Persson (known to fans by his in-game handle \"Notch\") hired staff and eventually turned over daily programming duties to other folks. These days, Notch spends his days developing other games and being <a href=\"http://penny-arcade.com/report/editorial-article/notch-interview\">interviewed</a> by famous Internet journalists, while <em>Minecraft</em> thrives on multiple platforms including PC, Mac, Linux, and XBox 360.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/09/blocks-with-friends-how-to-run-your-own-minecraft-server/\">Read 65 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/09/blocks-with-friends-how-to-run-your-own-minecraft-server/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/gF8kfzrsazCB0-hzE8UhHqMiCEY/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/gF8kfzrsazCB0-hzE8UhHqMiCEY/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/gF8kfzrsazCB0-hzE8UhHqMiCEY/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/gF8kfzrsazCB0-hzE8UhHqMiCEY/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/9tqTYR55SPM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

For every characteristic that we associate with a particular sex, the animal kingdom harbors at least one surprising exception; concepts that we believe are inextricably linked are uncoupled, and even reversed, in other species.</p>\n<p>Our sex exerts an incredible influence on our lives, influencing anatomy, appearance, behavior, and countless other traits. Socially, our sex also matters in terms of how we are understood and treated by others, because we see each other through a gendered lens. <a href=\"http://www.naceweb.org/gender/\">Female college graduates</a> are hired more often than male graduates, for instance, but earn 17 percent less than their male counterparts.

Available both as part of Server 2012 and as a free (as in beer) standalone installation, the third generation of Hyper-V brings with it a collection of features that largely commoditize the sorts of things you’ve gotten used to having to pay extra for. There are even a few features you couldn’t do <em>at all</em> with other hypervisors (like live migration of a server from one server to another with no shared storage between the two).</p>\n<p>Hyper-V supports a host of high-availability and “resiliency” features, such as off-site replication of servers. And it does many of those things as well or better than offerings from VMware and Citrix—regardless of whether you’re virtualizing Windows servers, Windows desktops, or Linux. And then there’s the free part: while the licenses for Windows Server itself are tied to a specific set of hardware, other operating systems can be hosted on the standalone Hyper-V server and managed as part of the same environment. All with the same sort of manageability.</p>\n<p>In this first look at Hyper-V 2012, we look at some of the high points of the hypervisor and its management environment from the perspective of a small to mid-sized enterprise. While many of the new features have been available on other virtualization platforms for some time, Hyper-V matters largely because of the way that Microsoft has tied them all up in a relatively simple and inexpensive package. This could potentially save organizations a significant amount of money—while preserving their sanity as well.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/09/first-look-hyper-v-2012-targets-vmwares-air-supply/\">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/09/first-look-hyper-v-2012-targets-vmwares-air-supply/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/qGk5X-tfvdXUa6UX_AQ5sUk8DJc/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/qGk5X-tfvdXUa6UX_AQ5sUk8DJc/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/qGk5X-tfvdXUa6UX_AQ5sUk8DJc/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/qGk5X-tfvdXUa6UX_AQ5sUk8DJc/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/FixehGsitwM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

Behind Door Number One sits a free-to-watch service that uses off-the-shelf technology and that buffers just enough of each show to put the live stream on the Internet. Behind Door Number Two lies a subscription service that requires custom-designed hardware and makes dozens of copies of each show. Which sounds easier to build—and to use?

That technology, supplied by a subsidiary of the French IT firm Bull, used a technique called deep packet inspection (DPI) to capture e-mails, chat messages, and Web visits of Libyan citizens.</p>\n<p>The fact that the Qaddafi regime was using deep packet inspection technology wasn’t surprising. Many governments have invested heavily in packet inspection and related technologies, which allow them to build a picture of what passes through their networks and what comes in from beyond their borders. The tools secure networks from attack—and help keep tabs on citizens.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.narus.com/\">Narus</a>, a subsidiary of Boeing, supplies “cyber analytics” to a customer base largely made up of government agencies and network carriers. Neil Harrington, the company’s director of product management for cyber analytics, said that his company’s “enterprise” customers—agencies of the US government and large telecommunications companies—are ”more interested in what's going on inside their networks” for security reasons. But some of Narus’ other customers, like Middle Eastern governments that own their nations’ connections to the global Internet or control the companies that provide them, “are more interested in what people are doing on Facebook and Twitter.”</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/08/big-brother-meets-big-data-the-next-wave-in-net-surveillance-tech/\">Read 63 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/08/big-brother-meets-big-data-the-next-wave-in-net-surveillance-tech/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/C0feMutPRInXFsJpDul1xmeaaoU/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/C0feMutPRInXFsJpDul1xmeaaoU/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/C0feMutPRInXFsJpDul1xmeaaoU/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/C0feMutPRInXFsJpDul1xmeaaoU/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/3w0FQVI8TU8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

Since the first models hit the market, the Ultrabook moniker—originally created to denote a thin, light laptop using a low-voltage Intel processor and a fast solid-state drive—has come to encompass just about any laptop that is thinner or lighter than usual.</p>\n<p>Acer's Aspire Timeline M5-481TG is one such computer. Acer officially refers to it as an Ultrabook, but its 14\" screen and 4.3 pound weight definitely push the limits of the term. That said, the M5 uses the extra size and weight to its advantage, packing a dedicated graphics processor and a DVD burner into a relatively thin-and-light frame. It's not the fastest gaming notebook on the market, and it's definitely not the thinnest and lightest. But can this laptop's specs make it a solid all-rounder, or does the approach simply produce a chunky, compromised Ultrabook?</p>\n<table class=\"specifications center\" width=\"500\">\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\" colspan=\"2\">Specs at a glance: Acer Aspire Timeline Ultra M5-481TG</th>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<th>Screen</th>\n<td>1366x768 at 14\" (112 ppi)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<th>OS</th>\n<td>Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<th>CPU</th>\n<td>1.7GHz Intel Core i5-3317U (Turbo boost up to 2.6GHz)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<th>RAM</th>\n<td>4GB 1333MHz DDR3 (officially supports up to 6GB, reports say it can support 10GB)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<th>GPU</th>\n<td>1GB NVIDIA GeForce GT 640M LE and Intel HD Graphics 4000 (switchable)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<th>HDD</th>\n<td>2.5” 5400RPM 500GB hard drive, 20GB SSD</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<th>Networking</th>\n<td>Gigabit Ethernet, dual-band 802.11n, Bluetooth 4.0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<th>Ports</th>\n<td>2x USB 3.0, HDMI, card reader, headphones</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<th>Size</th>\n<td>13.4\" x 0.8\" x 9.6\"</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<th>Weight</th>\n<td>4.30 lbs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<th>Battery</th>\n<td>3-cell 4850 mAh Li-ion</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<th>Price as reviewed</th>\n<td><a href=\"http://us.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/model/NX.M27AA.001\">$779.99</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<th>Other perks</th>\n<td>Webcam, backlit keyboard, DVD burner, 1 year warranty</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Design and build quality</h2>\n<p>The M5 is constructed entirely from plastic—the lid, display bezel, and top case are all dark gray and have a faux-brushed metal look, while the bottom of the laptop is a black, textured matte plastic. There's a bit of flexing in the top case, especially in the lid, but the laptop has a nice dense feel to it and doesn't feel overly cheap in spite of its construction. The M5 is of a uniform, 0.8\" thickness throughout, with none of the tapering seen in many Ultrabooks, and the laptop's lid sits flush with its slightly raised LCD hinge when closed. The hinge itself feels sturdy, but not so stiff that you can't open the laptop without holding the bottom down.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/trying-to-have-it-all-acers-timeline-m5-gaming-ultrabook/\">Read 35 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/trying-to-have-it-all-acers-timeline-m5-gaming-ultrabook/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/QBnChJFy55yrEvKPOY-GQ89y3g8/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/QBnChJFy55yrEvKPOY-GQ89y3g8/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/QBnChJFy55yrEvKPOY-GQ89y3g8/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/QBnChJFy55yrEvKPOY-GQ89y3g8/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/o0lGdZeWgcg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

You check the available WiFi networks: \"Free Stadium WiFi.\" You select, but deep in your heart you know there's no chance of connecting up here, 100 feet below the cloud cover. And that's when you come to a horrific realization: I'm going to have to put my phone in my pocket and <em>actually</em> pay attention.</p>\n<p>It's a “scary” thought for sports fans: Someday soon, the wireless network at your favorite team’s stadium could be so congested you’ll actually be forced to—gasp!—watch the game you paid a ticket for. People like Katee Panter, VP of infrastructure technology at Madison Square Garden in New York, fear growing use of smartphones and tablets to surf the Web or stream video will make it difficult to provide cellular and WiFi connections for everyone. Teams are taking advantage of fans' handheld devices by building apps to serve up interactive experiences or provide an easier way to order food and beverages. But delivering wireless Internet connections to tens of thousands of densely packed people is no easy technological feat.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/features/2012/08/why-your-smart-device-cant-get-wifi-in-the-home-teams-stadium/\">Read 27 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/features/2012/08/why-your-smart-device-cant-get-wifi-in-the-home-teams-stadium/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/t_liO1P8J2caH3JyrMGeIDQQnk0/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/t_liO1P8J2caH3JyrMGeIDQQnk0/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/t_liO1P8J2caH3JyrMGeIDQQnk0/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/t_liO1P8J2caH3JyrMGeIDQQnk0/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/KIAxQJTRi7o\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

754e8f6e-3403-3538-677f-2d202e027a94.description	"<p>We had such hopes for Intel's Ultrabook movement. With the first clarion call, we <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2011/09/ultrabook-intels-300-million-plan-to-beat-apple-at-its-own-game/\">dreamed of a PC</a> that would shatter Apple's monopoly on high-quality ultra-thin-and-light notebooks. In the first year of the Ultrabook campaign, we saw a few possible claimants to the throne, but in general, each entry was more disappointing than the last. The machines became notorious for using workarounds like larger screens (a 14-inch monitor in a 13-inch body!) and hard disk drives with flash caches (rather than actual solid-state drives) to skirt Intel's Ultrabook speed and size requirements.</p>\n<p>Nearly a year after Intel launched the initiative, manufacturers have finally taken the Ultrabook specs to heart. Lenovo's ThinkPad X1 Carbon reflects what we feel is the <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/01/ultra-in-name-only-the-failures-of-intels-ultrabook-rules/\">true spirit of an Ultrabook</a>: a light, thin body with powerful internals. Lenovo gets it. At long last, PCs have a real shot at the segment Apple has been dominating for years with the MacBook Air.</p>\n<div class=\"image center full-width\" style=\"width:640px\"><img src=\"http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/thinkpad_x1_carbon_keyboard.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"508\"></div>\n<h2>The touch, the feel of rubberized silicone</h2>\n<p>First, the waifish body: at a base 2.99 pounds, 0.31 inches at its thinnest point, and 0.74 inches at its thickest, the X1 Carbon has similar dimensions to the MacBook Air (2.96 pounds and 0.68 inches at its thickest). But that's the 13-inch MacBook Air; the X1 Carbon actually has a 14-inch 1600×900 screen packed into a \"13-inch body,\" as hardware manufacturers are recently so fond of saying. The extra display area is noticeable compared to a 13-inch computer, yet our backs and shoulders don't suffer any more for the extra real estate. And when we say 13-inch body, we mean it; the X1 Carbon is 13.03 inches wide by 8.9 inches deep, comparing well with the MacBook Air at 12.8 by 8.94 inches.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/a-worthy-ultrabook-appears-the-thinkpad-x1-carbon-reviewed/\">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/a-worthy-ultrabook-appears-the-thinkpad-x1-carbon-reviewed/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/EKJppYCqOw0fihWnleJoA8zArOg/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/EKJppYCqOw0fihWnleJoA8zArOg/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/EKJppYCqOw0fihWnleJoA8zArOg/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/EKJppYCqOw0fihWnleJoA8zArOg/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/yu-uBCAu2t8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

The same variety that makes it possible for you to find a laptop specifically designed to manage both your neon geranium business <em>and</em> your online polka-streaming startup also means that the market is flooded with laptops that <em>aren't</em> tailored to your particular needs. It's much more work than it's worth to educate yourself on every tiny difference between laptop A from manufacturer X and laptop B from manufacturer Y.</p>\n<p>We're here to help. To give you some guidance in this back-to-school season, we've set up three basic laptop categories. <strong>Basic laptops</strong> emphasize price over performance or size; <strong>gaming laptops</strong> emphasize performance over price or size; and <strong>lightweight laptops</strong> emphasize size over price or performance. Each is further subdivided into price ranges.</p>\n<p>Every category features picks that, in our view, represent some of the best machines available now. In most cases, we've also included a few alternatives in case something about our main pick was a dealbreaker for you. With a little luck, you'll be able to find something tailored to your needs and budget.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/the-ars-pc-laptop-buying-guide-back-to-school-edition/\">Read 54 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/the-ars-pc-laptop-buying-guide-back-to-school-edition/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/4knzOxlKIRQEpXa-PjjIk2rbdOA/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/4knzOxlKIRQEpXa-PjjIk2rbdOA/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/4knzOxlKIRQEpXa-PjjIk2rbdOA/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/4knzOxlKIRQEpXa-PjjIk2rbdOA/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/azITQy1EzUw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

But the prosecutors sitting across the courtroom from him didn't work for the Crown—they were lawyers for the movie studio trade group Federation Against Copyright Theft (FACT).</p>\n<p>FACT, not public officials in the UK, was the driving force behind Vickerman's prosecution. Indeed, FACT effectively took on the role of a private law enforcement agency. Private investigators hired by FACT first identified Vickerman as the administrator of STC and built the case against him. His assets were frozen at FACT's request by a government agency—which was itself funded by FACT. And when the UK's public prosecutors decided not to press charges against Vickerman at all, FACT initiated a criminal prosecution on its own dime.</p>\n<p>This is a new development for anti-piracy efforts. Organizations like the MPAA, RIAA, IFPA, and FACT have long lobbied law enforcement officials to prosecute \"rogue sites\" and have provided them with information and logistical support to do so. But public prosecutors generally have the final say on who will be indicted. In the Vickerman case, the public prosecutors concluded that there wasn't enough evidence to merit prosecution. FACT disagreed and invoked what one lawyer told us is an \"archaic right\" for a private organization to bring criminal prosecutions against other private parties.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/08/private-justice-how-hollywood-money-put-a-brit-behind-bars/\">Read 44 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/08/private-justice-how-hollywood-money-put-a-brit-behind-bars/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/dLRxJ5Go-chXQxIhSNJvsqH5wZY/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/dLRxJ5Go-chXQxIhSNJvsqH5wZY/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/dLRxJ5Go-chXQxIhSNJvsqH5wZY/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/dLRxJ5Go-chXQxIhSNJvsqH5wZY/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/LKpXpY0nyuA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

With the rise of whole new classes of \"personal computers\"—tablets and smartphones—it's worth updating all the numbers once more. And when we do so, we see something surprising: the adoption rates for our beloved mobile devices absolutely blow away the last few decades of desktop computer growth. People are adopting new technology faster than ever before.</p>\n<p>Humans are naturally competitive creatures. Not only do we compete with each other for money and power, but we form strong allegiances to various tribes. Whether it's a favorite sports team or a chosen computing platform, we passionately cheer when they win and feel a punch in our guts when they lose. Companies know this, and they will trumpet their successes and quietly hide their failures. But is it any more important to want one multi-billion dollar company to win over another than it is to root for one arbitrary multi-million dollar athlete? Is it anything more than cheerleading?</p>\n\n<p>Well—there's certainly plenty of cheerleading, but tracking the rise of fall of market share over time has more serious uses, too. Software developers need to keep track of market share so they can decide where to invest their resources. Consumers may then choose platforms based on software availability. Platforms can live—and sometimes die—by market share. The successes and failures of one generation of platforms affect the next, and ultimately this has an impact on everyone's digital lives.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/business/2012/08/from-altair-to-ipad-35-years-of-personal-computer-market-share/\">Read 50 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/business/2012/08/from-altair-to-ipad-35-years-of-personal-computer-market-share/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/flSZkEK2_wLwv67uQ_nkbYUcorc/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/flSZkEK2_wLwv67uQ_nkbYUcorc/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/flSZkEK2_wLwv67uQ_nkbYUcorc/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/flSZkEK2_wLwv67uQ_nkbYUcorc/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/jYz2MMZLQqY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

It responds by speaking back to the user and displaying relevant information. You can use the speech interface to dictate an e-mail or text message, search Google, perform a calculation or unit conversion, get the definition of a word, get a stock quote, search the platform’s built-in addressbook, set an alarm, play a song, get travel directions, get the current weather conditions in a region, or launch an application. The range of supported commands and queries is comparable to Siri's.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/review-androids-google-now-can-teach-siri-a-few-tricks/\">Read 43 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/review-androids-google-now-can-teach-siri-a-few-tricks/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/wI2qe0RCBRrNx0yq0Nt41V6Eahc/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/wI2qe0RCBRrNx0yq0Nt41V6Eahc/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/wI2qe0RCBRrNx0yq0Nt41V6Eahc/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/wI2qe0RCBRrNx0yq0Nt41V6Eahc/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/nkwuBC0j31Y\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

Its absence was brutally disappointing; thankfully, Tim Cook broke his vow of secrecy to reassure us that a new Mac Pro will arrive in 2013. But for filmmakers compressing hours of 4K footage or school labs in need of new Maya machines, that’s a long time to wait—perhaps too long. Since I was also in the market for a machine to help out with my V-Ray renders, I decided that the time had come to evaluate my alternatives. The current Westmere-based Mac Pro line is definitely out of sync with what’s available elsewhere, and it is no longer competitive from a price-to-power standpoint.</p>\n<p>I have heard it said that Dell, HP, and Apple split the workstation market pretty much three ways; whether or not this is true, it did seem worth taking a look at how the other big boys’ hot-rods rolled. The HP Z820 and Dell Precision T5600 are both monstrous dual-socket Intel E5-2665 Xeons clocked at 2.4GHz and, if I had to guess, I’d say that they are much like what would have replaced the dual Westmere Xeon 2.66GHz Mac Pro <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/2010/10/tri-screen-cpu-monitor-ars-reviews-the-12-core-2010-mac-pro/\">that I reviewed in 2010</a>.</p>\n<p>Of course, you can still build your own workstation, but I’m writing this for an audience who needs top-tier support and doesn’t want to chase six different companies when something goes wrong. I have my own overclocked 3930K gaming rig dual-booting Linux and Windows, but as I’ve pointed out countless times in the comments section of my Mac Pro reviews, a workstation needs to do one thing: keep working. Vendor support remains key to making this happen.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/as-mac-pro-stagnates-pc-workstations-muscle-ahead/\">Read 93 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/as-mac-pro-stagnates-pc-workstations-muscle-ahead/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/fn_wIMbfc-7y7iitMeT2152bWG0/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/fn_wIMbfc-7y7iitMeT2152bWG0/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/fn_wIMbfc-7y7iitMeT2152bWG0/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/fn_wIMbfc-7y7iitMeT2152bWG0/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/Xuqtj50gGio\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

Venus is similar in size and mass to our planet, but its broiling hot surface temperature and sulfuric acid rain put some hard limits on comparisons; other interesting worlds lack atmospheres or are frozen over. But Mars has potential. Despite the thin carbon dioxide atmosphere and low surface gravity (if you weigh 150 pounds on Earth, you'd only weigh 56 pounds on Mars), the planet is just enough like Earth to offer the promise of habitability—whether in the future by humans, or in the past or present by native life forms.</p>\n<p>So it's no surprise that Mars was an exploration target from the very beginning of spaceflight. The first missions sent to Mars by the Soviet Union began in 1960, a scant three years after Sputnik. The first successful flyby came in 1965 with NASA's Mariner 4, and the first successful landing was the Soviet Mars 3 in 1971. That lander ceased transmission soon after touchdown, which is common on the Red Planet—Wikipedia's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration_of_Mars#Timeline\">timeline of Mars exploration</a> is a sobering read for that very reason.</p>\n<p>The many failures make the successful landings look even more amazing. With the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover, known as Curiosity, arriving on-planet August 6, we're going to take a look back at the landers and rovers that brought us to today.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/2012/08/mars-needs-rovers-and-its-getting-a-big-one/\">Read 26 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/2012/08/mars-needs-rovers-and-its-getting-a-big-one/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/7If4mo7pHL6NUwUJCl060HfIlag/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/7If4mo7pHL6NUwUJCl060HfIlag/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/7If4mo7pHL6NUwUJCl060HfIlag/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/7If4mo7pHL6NUwUJCl060HfIlag/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/RgP-rDJvKi0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

Founded by the former senior VP of Apple's iPod division, Tony Fadell, along with his partner Matt Rogers, Nest Labs set out to create what is essentially the iPod of the thermostat world. The round, user-friendly device was initially met with excellent reviews, but were these based in reality or were they the result of some Apple-like hype?</p>\n<p>I like to think of myself as somewhat of a thermostat nerd. (Listen, it doesn't sound very exciting because it's not, but I like them). I am fascinated by thermostats and their usability, but I also don't like to spend too much money on them—unless the extra cost is worth it. Friends and Twitter followers have long asked me to evaluate higher-end thermostats, and I'm always examining the thermostats at other people's houses. So when I finally had the opportunity to install a Nest, I jumped at it.</p>\n<p>Now that I've been using the Nest for several months, I have a pretty good feel for its strengths and weaknesses—at least compared to what is typically available on the market. Is the Nest really worth the $250 it costs to obtain one, just so you can have a fancier way of turning the temperature up and down? I think so—especially if you're the \"convenience oriented\" type (that's PC for \"lazy\").</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/a-thermostat-that-learns-three-months-with-the-nest/\">Read 44 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/a-thermostat-that-learns-three-months-with-the-nest/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/Jgvmmo8M68VUN6mGvaW8S6RYeLU/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/Jgvmmo8M68VUN6mGvaW8S6RYeLU/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/Jgvmmo8M68VUN6mGvaW8S6RYeLU/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/Jgvmmo8M68VUN6mGvaW8S6RYeLU/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/vdYSbKar1us\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

50235823-bb15-54b6-e685-5d7e1dd2e058.description	"<p>In <a\nhref=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2012/09/features-perl-5-needs-in-2012.html\">Features\nPerl 5 Needs in 2012</a>, I wrote that Perl 5 needs \"compact, native-type data\nstructures\".</p>\n\n<p>While I generally <em>like</em> the polymorphism by which I can read\nexternal data into a data structure and then treat it like the kind of data I\nwant it to be (string, integer, numeric), that flexibility is never free.\nSometimes that flexibility comes at a cost.</p>\n\n<p>I have mixed feelings about the <a\nhref=\"http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/\">Computer Language Benchmarks Game</a>\nwhen used to compare languages, but its microbenchmarks are good targets for\nprofiling data. (I used that strategy to good effect when I worked on Parrot.\nCertainly Parrot could benefit from other performance improvements, but\nremoving low-hanging bottlenecks to maximum performance helped real programs in\nmeasurable ways.)</p>\n\n<p>Earlier this year, I profiled the <a\nhref=\"http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u64q/program.php?test=meteor&lang=perl&id=2\">benchmarks\ngame Perl meteor-contest entry</a>. I didn't expect to find any obvious\ncandidates for optimizing Perl 5, nor did I. I did find results that confirmed\nsome of my expectations.</p>\n\n<p>The program spends a lot of its time manipulating SVs. In fact, about 20% of\nthe runtime of the program goes to this. This is almost exclusively upgrading\nSVs. (An SV is the basic data type in Perl 5. It can store an integer value, a\nstring value, a numeric value, and more.)</p>\n\n<p>Here's the problem. The profile shows that this program performs almost\n65,000 array assignment operations (that's separate from a <code>push</code> or\na <code>splice</code>). This ends up in the guts of the Perl 5 function\n<code>Perl_pp_aassign</code> in <em>pp_hot.c</em>, which eventually gets to\nthis code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>\n        <span class=\"Identifier\">while</span> (<span class=\"Identifier\">relem</span> &lt;= <span class=\"Identifier\">lastrelem</span>) {    /* <span class=\"Identifier\">gobble</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">up</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">all</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">the</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">rest</span> */\n        <span class=\"Identifier\">SV</span> **<span class=\"Identifier\">didstore</span>;\n        <span class=\"Identifier\">assert</span>(*<span class=\"Identifier\">relem</span>);\n        <span class=\"Identifier\">sv</span> = <span class=\"Identifier\">newSV</span>(<span class=\"Constant\">0</span>);\n        <span class=\"Identifier\">sv_setsv</span>(<span class=\"Identifier\">sv</span>, *<span class=\"Identifier\">relem</span>);\n        *(<span class=\"Identifier\">relem</span>++) = <span class=\"Identifier\">sv</span>;\n        <span class=\"Identifier\">didstore</span> = <span class=\"Identifier\">av_store</span>(<span class=\"Identifier\">ary</span>,<span class=\"Identifier\">i</span>++,<span class=\"Identifier\">sv</span>);\n        <span class=\"Statement\">if</span> (<span class=\"Identifier\">magic</span>) {\n            <span class=\"Statement\">if</span> (<span class=\"Identifier\">SvSMAGICAL</span>(<span class=\"Identifier\">sv</span>))\n            <span class=\"Identifier\">mg_set</span>(<span class=\"Identifier\">sv</span>);\n            <span class=\"Statement\">if</span> (!<span class=\"Identifier\">didstore</span>)\n            <span class=\"Identifier\">sv_2mortal</span>(<span class=\"Identifier\">sv</span>);\n        }\n        <span class=\"Identifier\">TAINT_NOT</span>;\n        }</code></pre>\n\n<p>Essentially, for every element to assign to the array, create an entirely\nnew SV, copy in the contents of the old SV (remember, copy semantics!), and\nmove on. That copy operation ends up in <code>Perl_sv_setsv_flags()</code> in\n<em>sv.c</em> which goes through all sorts of gyrations to figure out what type\nof SV the destination should be.</p>\n\n<p>Hold on, didn't that SV already get created? Yes it did, but it's not the\nright type. It might not be big enough to hold the right data from the source.\nAfter some 400 lines of heavily macroed code, it does eventually get the right\ndata.</p>\n\n<p>This program profiles at 1.1 million SV copy operations. In almost 450,000\nof those, the source is <code>undef</code>, so nothing has to happen. In about\n580,000 of those, the source is a plain integer value.</p>\n\n<p>An integer is just data. It doesn't even need an SV if it's only ever\ntreated as an integer. It doesn't need copying, because it can happily remain\nan integer value.</p>\n\n<p>(Yes, if you're concerned that integer could ever overflow the 64 bits\nyou're probably using to store integers, you have to figure out a way to\nupgrade to some sort of arbitrary sided big integer, but that's very\ndoable.)</p>\n\n<p>It turns out that this program spends a lot of time bookkeeping polymorphic\ninternal data structures to store raw integers. That's not counting all of the\ntime spent manipulating the reference counts of raw integers or checking to see\nif you need to do anything special to get or store the value of and from a raw\ninteger.</p>\n\n<p>If it were possible to add type annotations to Perl 5 such that an integer\ncould only ever be an integer and never silently upgraded or an array could\nonly contain integers, it would be possible to update this program to get a\nsignificant amount of speed. A 10% improvement is within the realm of\npossibility, if not more. (I find the program a little too dense to skim and\nexplain at the same time I've been digging into the Perl 5 source code, so I\nwave my hands a little bit.)</p>\n\n<p>Sure, <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?PDL\">PDL</a> is great and I've\nused it effectively, and I'm fully capable of translating this code into XS\nwhere I <em>can</em> perform these manipulations in C where I <em>can</em>\nspecify their types, but crossing the barrier between Perl and PDL can be\ncostly unless you're very clever, and I don't want to write any more C than I\nhave to when Perl could make my job much more convenient.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, adding typed data structures to Perl 5 is a <em>huge</em>\namount of work. It would probably make the already complicated\n<code>Perl_sv_setsv_flags()</code> even more difficult to follow. It would\nrequire rewriting a lot of the internals. It probably depends on attaching\nthings like special behaviors to SV data structures instead of the bodies of\nPerl 5 operations, but that's also a good thing.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, using less memory and going faster is a good\nthing&mdash;and optional typing could open the door to further improvements\nsuch as type-directed optimizations and JITting.</p>\n\n<p>I know I said \"Perl 5 needs this feature in 2012\", but given the amount of work necessary to implement it, I have to back off a little bit to say that it would be nice to have. I hope you can see its value, and I hope it's possible to get it in a version of the Perl language sometime in the next couple of years.</p>"

8df8e675-b002-5e6a-b22d-09a1730419fc.description	"<p>When I wrote <a href=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2012/09/features-perl-5-needs-in-2012.html\">Features Perl 5 Needs in 2012</a>, I promised to explain my thinking. I've explained <a href=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2012/09/why-perl-5-needs-a-metaobject-protocol.html\">Why Perl 5 Needs a Metaobject Protocol</a> and previously <a href=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2010/10/reinventing-the-axle.html\">Why Perl 5 Needs a Compiler-Free Extension Mechanism</a>.</p>\n\n<p>(If you don't follow the latter link, ask yourself this: would you use Perl\n5 on another VM if you didn't have access to the CPAN? As long as any CPAN\nstack you need includes an XS dependency, you're stuck with the C\nimplementation of Perl 5. Break that dependency and... you see where this is\ngoing.)</p>\n\n<p>If you read a good book on compilers such as <a\nhref=\"http://www.amazon.com/Structure-Interpretation-Computer-Programs-Engineering/dp/0262011530?tag=onyneopre-20\">SICP</a>\nor <a\nhref=\"http://www.amazon.com/Compilers-Principles-Techniques-Tools-2nd/dp/0321486811/?tag=onyneopre-20\">the\nDragon book</a> or even a good book on <a\nhref=\"http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Common-Lisp-Peter-Seibel/dp/1590592395/ref=sr_1_3?tag=onyneopre-20\">Lisp</a>,\nwhich is half of the same thing, you'll eventually run into the idea that you\ncan represent any program in a tree-like structure.</p>\n\n<p>That is to say, any type of computation you wish to perform can be\nrepresented with the right data structure, and that data structure happens to\nbe a tree. Even the venerable \"Hello, world!\" program from K&amp;R is a\ntree:</p>\n\n<pre><code>\nSTATEMENTS\n    / \\\nprint  exit\n  |      |\n\"Hello,  0\n world!\"</code></pre>\n\n<p>(You can represent this tree in a lot of ways, but you get the idea.) As\nSICP explains, the execution model governs how you traverse this tree.\nObviously in this tree, you start at the topmost node, then evaluate leftmost\ndepthfirst until you end.</p>\n\n<p>Even though your processor likely doesn't execute programs by traversing\ntrees and your language's favorite runtime doesn't either, tree structures are\nstill very useful in compilers because they're simple data structures that are\neasy to traverse and produce and manipulate.</p>\n\n<p>This is one reason that fans of Lisp think that Lisp is the ultimate\nprogramming language: you write it by writing this tree directly as source code\nand you can manipulate that tree with source code as if it were a tree, because\nit is.</p>\n\n<p>Many of the rest of us don't want to spend the rest of our lives writing\ntrees by hand, but sometimes we <em>do</em> want to do things with source code\nwithout having to write our own compilers, or at least our own parsers.</p>\n\n<p>Do you know know people say \"<a\nhref=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2009/08/on-parsing-perl-5.html\">Parsing\nPerl is Hard</a>?\" That's because it is. It's not <em>impossible</em>, but the\nPerl 5 parser is a complicated program that mixes up the traditional roles of\nlexing and parsing such that replicating that parse completely is difficult, at\nbest. This is why writing a syntax highlighter for Perl 5 is more difficult\nthan writing one for Lisp.</p>\n\n<p>Do you know how something like <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Devel::Declare\">Devel::Declare</a> works?\nI do, and I don't want to explain it to you. It's not particularly yucky magic,\nbut it's not particularly lovely magic either.</p>\n\n<p>Do you know how Perl 5's optimizer works? It's very limited.</p>\n\n<p>Do you know how Perl 5 source filters work? Not that well! That's why <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Switch\">the Switch module</a> was\ndeprecated in the commit after it became a core module.</p>\n\n<p>Do you know how <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/PPI\">PPI</a> works? Most of\nthe time, very well, but with lots of magic and a few very well understood edge\ncases and not a lot of speed.</p>\n\n<p>All of these problems have the same root cause: it's exceedingly difficult\nto manipulate a Perl 5 program as anything other than text, because the one\nthing that unambiguously understands that program won't share its\nunderstanding.</p>\n\n<p>(That's not <em>entirely</em> true; a few years ago, Larry added a\ncompile-time option to Perl 5 to produce an annotated tree from the\nparser/lexer/compiler, but no one's done much with it.)</p>\n\n<p>A traditional compiler parses a document into a tree structure, then\nmanipulates that tree into at least one and probably more trees and finally\nemits code in another language. It's very patriotic (from tree to shining\ntree). This pattern is no accident; it's the basis of many programs (<a\nhref=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2011/08/everything-is-a-compiler.html\">everything\nis a compiler</a>).</p>\n\n<p>This process is so well understood that patterns exist for treating this\nprocess as a pipeline of tree transformations. As long as you know what kind of\ntree you're going to get and what kind of tree you need to produce, you can add\nyour own transformation step. (If that sounds like <a\nhref=\"http://plackperl.org/\">Plack middleware</a>, there's no coincidence there\neither.)</p>\n\n<p>A formalized AST in Perl 5, representing an official separation between the\nlexing/parsing and execution phases of Perl 5, made available to any and all\nprograms would let people write better syntax highlighters, sure, but also\nbetter IDEs (finding function declarations and associating them with source\ncode would be easier) or debuggers (see again \"finding things) or optimizers (a\npipeline of tree transformations) or transliterations to other VMs or languages\n(still not entirely <em>easy</em> but much more <em>possible</em>) or\nserialization mechanisms (avoid parsing; dump an AST to the execution engine)\nor even little languages atop Perl with their own parsers which compile to the\nPerl 5 AST and run as if they had been Perl all along.</p>\n\n<p>Think about that last point for a moment.</p>\n\n<p>(Think about that last point in the context of syntax weirding mechanisms\nlike <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?MooseX::Declare\">MooseX::Declare</a>, or\nanything which uses string <code>eval</code>.)</p>\n\n<p>Are you sold yet?</p>\n\n<p>Here's the bad news: this is a lot of work. It needs expertise and it needs\nresearch and planning. It needs at least one champion, and it probably needs\nfunding. The first approach will probably fail. It will take longer than anyone\nwants. The only way it will happen is if someone stubborn appears and says\n\"I'll do that!\" or \"I'll fund that!\" and gets just enough support to keep going\npast the difficult parts.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine how amazing it will be, though.</p>"

f4947092-5362-04eb-d9e9-8383daba93c3.description	"<p>In <a href=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2012/09/features-perl-5-needs-in-2012.html\">Features Perl 5 Needs in 2012</a>, I suggested five mostly-not-syntax features that Perl 5 could use right now.</p>\n\n<p>The caveat to all of these features is that 1) someone must <em>code</em>\nthem and 2) someone must <em>maintain</em> them. While p5p has traditionally\ndone a lot with a little, remember that any suggestions or discussions will\nonly make it into a Perl 5 release if enough effort goes into implementation to\nmake them happen. If you want any of these features to happen, contact TPF\nabout donations or volunteer your time and skills to help (even if all you feel\ncomfortable doing is helping to refine the design of a feature, that's\nworthwhile).</p>\n\n<p>I promised to explain these features in more detail. First up is a\nmetaobject protocol for Perl 5. Stevan Little and Jesse Luehrs are working on\n<a href=\"https://github.com/stevan/p5-mop\">a proof of concept MOP for Perl\n5</a>, so this feature is well underway.</p>\n\n<p>If you're not familiar with a metaobject protocol, the book <a\nhref=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Metaobject-Protocol-Gregor-Kiczales/dp/0262610744?tag=onyneopre-20\">The\nArt of the Metaobject Protocol</a> explains everything in extensive detail.\n(It's also a pretty good book about Common Lisp, so if you're interested in a\nsemi-practical theoretical exploration of why computer sciencey things like the\nlambda calculus and well-designed extension mechanisms matter, this is a great\nbook about the design and implementation of a language.)</p>\n\n<p>If you don't want to read ~350 pages right now, the short definition of a\nMOP is <em>an API for interacting with your object system</em>. Classes (if\nyour MOP supports them) are objects. You can define a new class by making\nmethod calls. You can create objects by making method calls. You can define an\nentirely new <em>style</em> of class by creating your own new metaclass with\ndifferent behaviors. This is the reason <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Class::MOP\">Class::MOP</a> predated <a\nhref=\"http://moose.perl.org/\">Moose</a>.</p>\n\n<p>A good MOP provides a great theoretical foundation for a wonderful object\nsystem. Where many of us have defended Perl 5's object system as \"minimal but\neffective and flexible\", a good MOP in the core would let us get rid of\n<code>bless</code> in our code... and have more good features.</p>\n\n<h2>Performance Improvements</h2>\n\n<p>Moose can be slow to start, if you have lots of little classes, all on disk\nin their individual modules. Not only are you doing lots of IO to find and load\nthose classes, but you have to build up all of the classes you've defined in\nmemory through Moose's import mechanism (<code>has()</code> and\n<code>extends()</code> and <code>with()</code> are all function calls) which\ncreates and populates a metaclass behind the scenes.</p>\n\n<p>This happens every time you start your program.</p>\n\n<p>Every MooseX extension you load changes things.</p>\n\n<p>Though some of this happens in XS, where memory use can be smaller (less\nPerl data structure overhead) and speed can be faster (the same algorithm done\nin C instead of something written atop C), much of this happens at the Perl 5\nlevel.</p>\n\n<p>A great MOP could have its own custom data structures and code in the core\nto represent classes and methods and attributes, rather than Perl 5 hashes and\narrays. A great MOP could have its own ops to handle things like introspection\nand dispatch. A great MOP could have parser support to avoid the overhead of\ncalling Perl 5 functions (or crossing the XS boundary) to perform basic\nsetup.</p>\n\n<h2>Simplicity of Alternate Object Systems</h2>\n\n<p>Perl 5's default object system is very flexible for strange people like me\nwho've programmed in far too many languages (and implemented a few) who like\nvarious features of multiple languages and think \"Hey, I know, I'll implement\nthis in Perl 5.\" You bless a reference. You invoke a method. That's it.\nEverything else you can build yourself.</p>\n\n<p>The downside is that you have to figure out how to build it yourself.\nSometimes that means even diving into the source code of Perl 5 <em>itself</em>\nto see how things happen.</p>\n\n<p>A good MOP provides a foundation on which you can provide your own custom\nbehavior. As long as you hew to the protocol it defines, you can do anything\nyou want: make a custom metaclass that allows simple and protected shared\nmemory between workers, provide automatic auditing around specific methods,\nproxy transparently to remote resources, anything.</p>\n\n<p>Better yet...</p>\n\n<h2>Interoperability Between Different Object Systems</h2>\n\n<p>One of the projects I maintain uses Moose heavily. One of its dependencies\npulls in <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Moo\">Moo</a>. The authors of\nboth object systems have gone to great lengths to make sure that both work\ntogether.</p>\n\n<p>With a good MOP in place in the core, you have to go to great lengths\n<em>not to interoperate well with other object systems</em>. The default is\ninteroperability.</p>\n\n<p>(Try that in Perl 5 now, where some of the web programming or IO classes\nbless typeglobs. Oh, you expected a blessed hash? Too bad!)</p>\n\n<h2>Syntactic Improvements</h2>\n\n<p>As I alluded to earlier, a good MOP opens the door for declarative syntaxes\nfor defining classes, methods, and attributes. We might finally get a\n<code>class</code> keyword and a <code>method</code> keyword. This is very nice\nbecause it'll be faster, but also...</p>\n\n<h2>Tool Improvements</h2>\n\n<p>... language keywords the language itself knows make their way into syntax\nhighlighters and static analysis tools and reformatters and refactorers. It's\neasy to get a list of all of the methods in all of the classes in a file when\nit's unambiguous to pick out all of the names of classes in a file because you\n<em>know</em> they all have the <code>class</code> keyword in front of them,\nfor example.</p>\n\n<p>Compare that to today, where anything that looks like a coderef in a\nnamespace is potentially a method or potentially a function and the only way to\nknow is to invoke it, and why bother even trying?</p>\n\n<h2>Current Status</h2>\n\n<p>It's difficult to argue against putting a MOP in the core. Stevan and Jesse\nare working hard on it, but they could use more eyeballs on the tests and\ndesign and certainly more testing on various platforms. If you've been looking\nfor an excuse to contribute to Perl 5.18 or Perl 5.20, this is a great place to\nstart.</p>"

(I'm perhaps most thankful for\nthe thankless work that's gone into Unicode 6.2 compliance and core support for\nUnicode throughout.) <a\nhref=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2012/05/why-i-use-perl-reliability.html\">The\nyearly release cycle has made Perl 5 even more reliable</a>, and that seems\nlikely to continue.</p>\n\n<p>A couple of years ago, someone asked me for my top five list of improvements\nPerl 5 needed.

For those playing along at home, I missed:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A yearly release cycle</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?feature\">feature</a> pragma</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For all its faults, <em>feature</em> broke the logjam by which it was\nimpossible to add new syntax or backwards-incompatible features to Perl 5. The\nmechanism isn't perfect (especially its implementation), but it allows\nprogress, and for that I'm thankful.</p>\n\n<p>I can't predict what will be ready for Perl 5.18 next April or May, but I\ncan update my list to include features I'd like to see in an upcoming release.\nI'll go into more detail of each of these features in future installments.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>A <a href=\"https://github.com/stevan/p5-mop\">metaobject protocol</a> in the\ncore, to improve Perl 5's object system in a well-defined way</li>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2010/10/reinventing-the-axle.html\">A ctypes-like replacement for simple XS</a></li>\n\n<li>A formalized AST between the parser and the code generator, with the\nability to manipulate the AST and inject new subtrees in pure Perl 5</li>\n\n<li>Compact, native-type data structures</li>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2012/09/the-advantages-of-declarative-exporting.html\">Declarative replacements for procedural code</a></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>(For the CL fans in the audience, I <em>like</em> syntax, and I have a lot\nof trouble giving up CPAN's breadth and cross-platform goodness.)</p>\n\n<p>What's on your list?</p>"

55036d80-db62-0c10-b07a-de606b9cfc72.description	"<p>I haven't written an infinite loop bug in a while. I suppose I was due. (The Greek gods always punish hubris.)</p>\n\n<p>I have a database table full of users. Let's call that table\n<code>user</code>. A user has one or more roles (from the <code>role</code>)\ntable. A user can be an unverified user, a free user, a subscriber, or an\nadministrator. (Administrators obviously are also subscribers, but you get the\npoint.)</p>\n\n<p>I use <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?DBIx::Class\">DBIx::Class</a>\nfor the database access layer. My <code>User</code> result class has a couple\nof methods which let other model actions query whether the user can perform\nspecific operations. They're <a\nhref=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2011/05/decoupling-testability-and-synthetic-attributes.html\">synthetic\nattributes</a>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>has [<span class=\"Constant\">qw(</span><span class=\"Constant\"> is_admin is_subscriber </span><span class=\"Constant\">)</span>], <span class=\"Constant\">is</span> =&gt; <span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">ro</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span>, <span class=\"Constant\">lazy_build</span> =&gt; <span class=\"Constant\">1</span>;\n\n<span class=\"Statement\">sub </span><span class=\"Identifier\">_build_is_admin      </span>{ <span class=\"Statement\">shift</span>-&gt;find_role_by_name( <span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">admin</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span>      ) }\n<span class=\"Statement\">sub </span><span class=\"Identifier\">_build_is_subscriber </span>{ <span class=\"Statement\">shift</span>-&gt;find_role_by_name( <span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">subscriber</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span> ) }</code></pre>\n\n<p>Obviously the implementation of <code>find_role_by_name()</code> is\nsupremely important. Here's how I originally wrote the code (no sense blaming\nanyone else for this, because <em>I</em> wrote all of the access control code\nmyself.) See if you can catch the bug:</p>\n\n<pre><code><span class=\"Statement\">sub </span><span class=\"Identifier\">find_role_by_name</span>\n{\n    <span class=\"Statement\">my</span> (<span class=\"Identifier\">$self</span>, <span class=\"Identifier\">$name</span>) = <span class=\"Identifier\">@_</span>;\n\n    <span class=\"Statement\">while</span> (<span class=\"Statement\">my</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$role</span> = <span class=\"Identifier\">$self</span><span class=\"Identifier\">-&gt;user_roles-&gt;next</span>)\n    {\n        <span class=\"Statement\">return</span> <span class=\"Constant\">1</span> <span class=\"Statement\">if</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$role</span><span class=\"Identifier\">-&gt;role-&gt;name</span> <span class=\"Statement\">eq</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$name</span>;\n    }\n\n    <span class=\"Statement\">return</span> <span class=\"Constant\">0</span>;\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>As a hint, the <code>user_roles</code> method represents the relationship\nbetween the <code>user</code> table and the <code>role</code> table. That\nmethod returns a DBIC resultset which represents the entries in the table with\na foreign key to the <code>user</code> table.</p>\n\n<p>See the bug yet? It took me a while. The problem is that <em>every\ninvocation of the loop</em> fetches a new resultset. Every invocation of the\nloop fetches only the <em>first</em> result from that resultset.</p>\n\n<p>My tests (yeah, I wrote the tests too, before I wrote this code in fact,\njust like you're supposed to do) didn't catch that because the rest of the code\nonly ever checked for one user role, the administrator role, anywhere else.\nOnly when I added code for the subscriber role did the subscription tests\ntrigger this infinite loop. (Now how abhorred in my imagination is that most\nexcellent jest!)</p>\n\n<p>I wish I could say that I diagnosed the cause immediately. I didn't. I\nstared at the code for far too long, until I had the presence of mind to put a\ndebugging statement in the loop body to print the name of the role.  (Stat\nofficium pristina nomine.)</p>\n\n<p>Here's the corrected code, with a single expression hoisted into a scalar\nvariable where it may endure properly:</p>\n\n<pre><code><span class=\"Statement\">sub </span><span class=\"Identifier\">find_role_by_name</span>\n{\n    <span class=\"Statement\">my</span> (<span class=\"Identifier\">$self</span>, <span class=\"Identifier\">$name</span>) = <span class=\"Identifier\">@_</span>;\n    <span class=\"Statement\">my</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$user_roles_rs</span> = <span class=\"Identifier\">$self</span><span class=\"Identifier\">-&gt;user_roles</span>;\n\n    <span class=\"Statement\">while</span> (<span class=\"Statement\">my</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$role</span> = <span class=\"Identifier\">$user_roles_rs</span><span class=\"Identifier\">-&gt;next</span>)\n    {\n        <span class=\"Statement\">return</span> <span class=\"Constant\">1</span> <span class=\"Statement\">if</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$role</span><span class=\"Identifier\">-&gt;role-&gt;name</span> <span class=\"Statement\">eq</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$name</span>;\n    }\n\n    <span class=\"Statement\">return</span> <span class=\"Constant\">0</span>;\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>I will say this: expecting your test suite to pass in under 30 seconds makes this sort of thing much easier to catch. If I'd had to wait for a continuous integration server to get around to checking this commit, I wouldn't have fixed it as quickly as I did.</p>\n\n<p>Then again, it's easier to debug bugs you never write in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>Oh, and if you catch the literary allusion in the title, here's your prize:\ncongratulations! You might be overeducated. (If you caught the other three\nallusions, have you ever noticed how much Pynchon's <em>V</em> influenced\nStephenson's <em>Cryptonomicon</em>?)</p>"

e8acdc48-6166-d5da-2652-96b74355dc8c.description	"<p>Today is Alan Turing&#8217;s 100th birthday. I&#8217;ve been thinking about him lately, in particular about a story that demonstrates the perils of working with genius.</p>\n<p>The story goes that, when Turing was working with the Manchester Baby (the first stored program computer ever built. Just) a colleague wrote the first ever assembler which would turn (relatively) human readable assembly language and turn it into the ones and zeroes of machine code that the machine could actually execute. He showed it to Turing, who blew up at him, ranting that using the computer to do &#8216;trivial&#8217; jobs like that were a massive waste of expensive computer time.</p>\n<p>The problem with working with a genius, from the point of view of more ordinary mortals, is that the genius has only a very rough idea of what is actually easy, and what is only easy to them. From today&#8217;s vantage point, when computers are as freely available as they are now, the idea of <em>not</em> letting the computer do the shitwork for you seems utterly ludicrous &#8211; programmer time is more valuable than computer time.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s less obvious is that the same was true in Turing&#8217;s time (when there was precisely one computer) too. It only takes one programmer to make a mistake in translating from assembler to machine code and run a job that, for instance, gets stuck in an infinite loop and you&#8217;ve probably wasted more computer time (and programmer time) than if you&#8217;d just run it through the assembler in the first place. Turing didn&#8217;t see that, because the process of translating from symbols to binary wasn&#8217;t something that he found particularly complicated. To him, what was needed wasn&#8217;t more and better tools, it was more and better Turings.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not entirely sure that I believe the story (and I can&#8217;t remember where I heard it, so it may be a phantom of my memory). It certainly doesn&#8217;t chime with the Turing who was instrumental in mechanising the shitwork of finding the days rotor settings so that Enigma traffic could be cracked. The history of Bletchley Park is a story of building better and better machines to do the dully repetitive jobs that humans find so hard to stick to and which machines excel at.</p>\n<p>The &#8220;Just write code without bugs in the first place&#8221; school of programming is alive and well today. It&#8217;s not my school though. I&#8217;m very much an exploratory coder. I like to have tests to show me the way and to keep me honest so that I don&#8217;t go breaking things when I change this bit here. I&#8217;ve customised my editing environment to help me as much as possible. I have a nasty habit of writing bare words that I should have quoted, so I have a keystroke that shoves the last word into quotes for me. Another keystroke will align all the broad arrows at the current level of nesting. I&#8217;ve got snippets set up that fill in standard boilerplate when I start a new class, a huge list of common spelling mistakes that get autocorrected while I&#8217;m not looking and an expanding list of other little helpers that I need to write when I get around to it. Automation lets me go faster, make more and better mistakes and recover from them faster. I am a of little brain and I want all the help I can give myself.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure that Turing would be in the same camp as me.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the thing though &#8211; Turing was, definitely, a genius. But his paper &#8220;On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem&#8221; (the one that gave the world the Turing Machine) has a bug in it. In fact, it has two. The first is obvious enough that I spotted it when i read the paper for the first time. The second bug is rather more subtle (but still fixable. It&#8217;s okay, the field of computing is not build on sand).</p>\n<p>I love that The Paper &#8211; The one that&#8217;s the theoretical basis for the modern world (first publishd 75 years ago, round(ish) number fans) &#8211; has a bug. It gives me a strange kind of hope. Fallibility gets us all &#8211; even people who have saved the world. I think we should celebrate the humanity as well as the genius. Turing was, by all accounts, a very odd fish, but the world is undeniably richer for his contributions.</p>\n<p>So, let&#8217;s raise a glass to the memory of Alan Turing tonight, marathon runner, gay icon, saviour of the world and the pleasantly fallible inventor of the modern world. Not a bad CV, when you think about it.</p>\n<h4>Updated</h4>\n<p>Apparently I&#8217;m wrong about it being Turing who didn&#8217;t like the assembler but Von Neumann (another genius). See below for details. And phew! How nice to find that a hero doesn&#8217;t have feet of clay.</p>"

It just so happened that <span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span> (Yet Another Perl Conference) was held in Asheville this year, the week before the gathering&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.swangathering.com/Catalog/TS/sgtssched.html\">Traditional Song Week</a>. Well, I&#8217;m a perl hacker. I sing traditional songs. My employer was paying for me to attend <span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span> and were willing for me to extend my stay in America by a week. It was a no brainer really.</p>\n<p><span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span> was bloody good this year. Perl 5 development is moving forward and the community is buzzing because of it. Lots of &#8220;… and we&#8217;re hiring&#8221; slides. And that&#8217;s before we get to the pleasure of catching up with friends that I only see online most of the time. If you&#8217;re working in any field that has grassroots conferences associated with it, I can&#8217;t recommend attending them highly enough.</p>\n<h3>On to Swannanoa</h3>\n<p>At Swannanoa, I met Sheila Kay Adams and immediately switched my schedule to spend as much time singing with her as possible. Sheila&#8217;s a seventh generation ballad singer from the Sodom Laurel community in Madison Count. Her &#8220;grannie Berzil&#8221; Wallin remembered Cecil Sharp coming to Madison County and collecting songs from the family.</p>\n<p>Pedigree in singing shouldn&#8217;t matter, but it turns out it does. Sheila grew up in a community which was changing, but which still had old &#8216;love songs&#8217; as an important part of how it understood the world. Today, not so much. People still relate to the world and understand it through songs, but the songs are more likely to be contemporary. Lyrically, many of the love songs that Sheila and her family sing could have been written yesterday, but their performance is radically different from contemporary style. One voice, unaccompanied, a style that requires the listener to concentrate on the song rather than any aspects of production. Not something you&#8217;re going to dance to at your wedding, say.</p>\n<p>Sheila&#8217;s classes, on Meeting House Songs (more later) and her Ballads class with Bobbie McMillon were just wonderful; I won&#8217;t forget in a hurry the sound Bobbie singing &#8220;A conversation with Death&#8221; as a thunderstorm grumbled across the campus in the background. Spine tingling stuff. Sheila&#8217;s description of how she learned songs &#8220;knee to knee&#8221; has been helpful too. The way it would work was that the teacher and student would be sat out on the porch, often doing some chore or another, and the teacher would sing the first verse of a song. The student would sing it back and the teacher would sing the second verse. The student would then sing the first two verses then the teacher would sing the third verse and the student would sing the first three verses and so on, until the student was singing the whole song back to the teacher. A time consuming process to be sure, but it works.</p>\n<p>I know this because I learned Pretty Saro from a recording of Sheila&#8217;s late husband Jim Taylor, using a variant of the method, &#8220;knee to CD&#8221; if you like. I&#8217;d play the first verse, hit pause and sing it back, play the second verse, pause, repeat the first two… and so on. And in very short order I had the words and tune (up to a point; I listened back to that recording again recently and I&#8217;m singing a different tune now) and could start the process of actually <em>learning</em> the song, which involved singing it it lots, listening to other recordings, singing it some more and then taking the song out and trying it out in front of audiences and listening to what works and what doesn&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve never really finished learning a song; this recording is a snapshot. I hope you enjoy it.</p>"

369ffedb-3225-1f04-6d95-b2f49c185b4f.description	"<p>I sometimes think that I should have published the lyrics to <a href=\"http://www.bofh.org.uk/child-of-the-library\">Child of the Library</a> with a bibliography. The references in the second verse are all obvious to me, but I&#8217;m a white middle class English boy who grew up around boats. My childhood reading and yours may not intersect all that much.</p>\n<p>So&#8230;</p>\n<h4>The Walkers and the Blacketts</h4>\n<p>Also known as the <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=intitle:%22Swallows+and+Amazons%22\">Swallows and Amazons.</a> <cite>Swallows and Amazons</cite> is the first &#8216;big&#8217; book that I can remember reading for myself. We were in Cornwall, holidaying at the same place my mum&#8217;s been going to since she was a kid. Mum was reading <cite>Swallows and Amazons</cite> to us, and it was great, but I was impatient to find out what happened next, so I took the book to bed with me and read it for myself. I haven&#8217;t stopped yet. <cite>Swallows and Amazons</cite> was the book that opened my door to reading for pleasure. It opened up a way of looking at the world too. I can&#8217;t imagine who I&#8217;d be if I&#8217;d never read any Ransome.</p>\n<h4>The Pevensies</h4>\n<p>The Pevensies are the family in <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=intitle:%22The+Lion+The+Witch+And+The+Wardrobe%22\">The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe,</a> the first of the Narnia books. I have a slightly troubled relationship with these books now. I <em>really</em> don&#8217;t get on with C. S. Lewis&#8217;s view of the world (I once hurled a taped reading of <cite>The Screwtape Letters</cite> out of the car rather than listen to another word of the bloody things), but I wasn&#8217;t reading between the lines when I was nine. I was just loving the stories and the images they put in my head. And what images&#8230;</p>\n<h4>Simp, the Canine Cannonball</h4>\n<p>What do you mean, you&#8217;ve never read <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=intitle:%22Cannonball+Simp%22\">Cannonball Simp?</a> You poor thing!</p>\n<p><cite>Cannonball Simp</cite>, by John Burningham is <em>the</em> library book for me. Back when I was 4 or 5, I would walk with my dad from Regent&#8217;s Square to the Doncaster Central Library every Saturday morning, with three books clutched under my arm. I&#8217;d hand them over the counter, receiving in exchange 3 buff cardboard library slip holders. I would then go over to the childrens&#8217; books section and pull out three new (to me) books and take them to the counter. The librarian would remove the slip from the library bookplate, place it in one of my surrendered holders and stamp the slip and the bookplate with the date, three weeks hence, by which the book must be renewed.</p>\n<p>Well, that&#8217;s how it worked until weekend I came back with <cite>Cannonball Simp</cite>. I <em>loved</em> it. I didn&#8217;t want to take it back because I hadn&#8217;t learned it yet. Sure I could &#8216;read&#8217; along with Dad &#8211; I knew all the words by then &#8211; but the pictures were another thing entirely. They were <em>beautiful</em>. They still are.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s when I learned of the magic of &#8216;renewal&#8217;. Instead of handing the book back, I showed it to the librarian and said &#8220;I&#8217;d like to renew this, please,&#8221; and instead of giving me my library card back, they just stamped the book and slip with a new date. Wow! It was like I <em>owned</em> the book.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know how many times I renewed that book. I&#8217;m afraid I don&#8217;t remember the words any more. But I still remember the pleasure that it gave me.</p>\n<h4>Galadriel the Fair</h4>\n<p>On the last day of junior school our form teacher, Miss Rees, wrote a long list of books on the board and asked us to copy the list into the back of our exercise books. She said that these were books we should try and read. I don&#8217;t have the exercise book any more and I remember very little of the list. I do remember that I&#8217;d already read some of them. And I remember <cite>The Hobbit</cite> and <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=intitle:%22The+Lord+of+the+Rings%22\">The Lord of the Rings</a>. Oh boy, do I remember <cite>The Hobbit</cite> and <cite>The Lord of the Rings</cite>.</p>\n<p>Terry Pratchett said that if you&#8217;re a 14 year old boy and you don&#8217;t think that The Lord of the Rings is the best book ever written then there may be something wrong with you, but if you&#8217;re 28 and you <em>still</em> think it&#8217;s the best book ever written then there&#8217;s <em>definitely</em> something wrong with you. I <em>was</em> that 14 year old boy. I stayed up all night reading it. I fell asleep reading it. I read the appendices. I worked out how to write my name in Elvish script. I even read <cite>The Silmarillion</cite> and thought I enjoyed it. I can still recite some of the poetry. In Elvish. I&#8217;ve forgotten the words of Cannonball Simp, but get me going with &#8220;A Elbereth Gilthoniel&#8230;&#8221; and I can just about reel off the rest of the poem. What&#8217;s wrong with me?</p>\n<p>By the time I was 28, LotR wasn&#8217;t the best book ever written. I&#8217;m no longer sure that there is such a thing as &#8220;The Best Book Ever Written&#8221;. Still, if you haven&#8217;t at least read <cite>The Hobbit</cite> you should take steps to rectify matters. Or wait for the Peter Jackson movie.</p>\n<h4>The Daughter of a Pirate King</h4>\n<p>Confession time: I haven&#8217;t read <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=intitle:%22Pippi+Longstocking%22\">Pippi Longstocking</a>. The &#8216;I&#8217; of <cite>A Child of the Library</cite> is a composite of Gill and me. <cite>Pippi Longstocking</cite> was her Nancy Blackett. The  <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=Bastable+inauthor:Nesbit\">Bastables</a> were her Pevensies.</p>\n<h4>Paddington the Bear</h4>\n<p>Once I&#8217;d learned that reading for myself was pure pleasure, I read anything and everything I could find in the library and I discovered Michael Bond&#8217;s <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=intitle:Paddington+inauthor:%22Michael+Bond%22\">Paddington Bear</a>. Paddington was a well meaning young bear from Peru who was found, wearing a duffel coat and a label reading &#8220;Please look after this bear&#8221;, at Paddington Station by the Brown Family. The Browns took him in immediately, named him Paddington after the station and&#8230; &#8216;hijinks ensue&#8217;.</p>\n<p>I would be quietly reading these books to myself when some episode or another (&#8220;Baked Elastic&#8221;; the Russian ballet dancer; the wobbly table&#8230;) would cause me to laugh out loud and my brother would demand to know what was funny and made me read whatever it was aloud to him. I have to confess, I resented this, but not enough to dent my enjoyment. The Paddington books are made of joy.</p>"

975489d8-2c71-8ff7-f964-73ac10cc82cb.description	"<p>Or… what I did this summer.</p>\n<p>Summer as been frantic. Mostly joyous, but frantic.</p>\n<p>I had talks accepted at both <a href=\"http://www.yapc2011.us/yn2011/\"><span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span></a> and <a href=\"http://oscon.com/\"><span class=\"caps\">OSCON</span></a>. Because <span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span> was in Asheville, and the <a href=\"http://www.swangathering.com/\">Swannanoa Gathering</a> Traditional Song Week fell the week after <span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span>, that meant I flew out to Asheville for an intense fortnight of Perl community engagement followed by a week spent singing myself hoarse and being blown away by <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/sheilakayadams\">Sheila Kay Adams&#8217;s</a> singing and her stories of mountain life and listening to future stars like <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/sheilakayadams\">Sam Gleaves</a> and inspiring activists like <a href=\"http://www.blairpathways.com/\">Saro Lynch Thomason</a>. I could write entire posts on every one of those, and that&#8217;s before I get on to the magic of watching the sun go down and the fireflies come up from the grass of the Warren Wilson College&#8217;s natural amphitheatre. Magical so it was.</p>\n<p>On the last night of the gathering, there was a student showcase. Of course, I sang <a href=\"http://www.bofh.org.uk/child-of-the-library\">Child of the Library</a>. Rather embarrassingly, I skipped a verse, but the response was great. Several people came up to me afterwards and told me their library stories and, I hope, went home with a determination to help protect their libraries.</p>\n<p>Then it was back to the UK for a fortnight before heading off again to <span class=\"caps\">OSCON</span> in Portland, OR. I was down to give two talks, one on <a href=\"http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011/public/schedule/detail/17872\">Higher Order Javascript</a> and a second on <a href=\"http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011/public/schedule/detail/18577\">Polymorphic Dispatch</a> which proved to be a bear to write. I&#8217;d planned to have everything done and dusted and the slides learned by the time I flew out, but spent a huge amount of time blocked on how I was going to present the ideas using a motivating problem that hit the sweet spot between too simple and too complicated. It wasn&#8217;t until I arrived in Portland and talked things through with my host, <a href=\"http://www.justatheory.com/\">David Wheeler</a>, that I got that worked out. The slides were written in a tearing rush and weren&#8217;t as good as I would like them to be. I still owe the talk attendees a full writeup, so I&#8217;ll take this opportunity to apologise for the lateness and promise that a writeup <em>will</em> arrive. The Javascript talk was based on one I&#8217;ve given before, but I&#8217;m starting to realise that it&#8217;s a full tutorial masquerading as a short talk. More on that later, I hope.</p>\n<p>What with flapping about the unwritten talk, and the 10 minute gap between them, I didn&#8217;t really worry overmuch about the Perl lightning talks. It&#8217;s been my practice to sing a lightly massaged version of <a href=\"http://LOUANDPETER.COM/\">Lou and Peter Berryman&#8217;s</a> very splendid song <cite>A Chat With Your Mother</cite> with tailored verses about different language communities and various Perl luminaries. I <em>had</em> decided to retire it, but at <span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span> I came up with a snide verse about myself and another about Larry Wall, so it felt renewed enough to be worth singing this year as well. I ended up singing Child of the Library again.</p>\n<p>The response was phenomenal. I&#8217;ve been singing it for long enough now that I know it <em>gets</em> people. Hell, when I was writing it, there were verses that were hard to sing because they got me and I was choking up as I tried to sing them. But the lightning talk got a standing ovation. Again people were telling me library stories and I found that the UK isn&#8217;t the only country with local governments stupid enough to consider closing libraries, it was happening in the US too. So, fired up by that response, I went to see Sarah Novotny and begged her for five minutes on the <span class=\"caps\">OSCON</span> stage before the closing keynote. Bless her, she let me have it.</p>\n<h3>Pics, or it didn&#8217;t happen!</h3>\n<p>I have proof too! The main stage at O&#8217;Reilly events has serious video equipment pointed at it. Because it&#8217;s important that people get to see serious talks about <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnX5v0uwNjc&amp;list=PL93FC98105B19725C&amp;index=39&amp;feature=plpp\">known bugs and exploits in wetware</a>. Because my performance wasn&#8217;t on the schedule, and I didn&#8217;t have a video release all signed and ready to go beforehand, it&#8217;s taken a while to get the video available. But last night, that changed, so here I am, in all my corpulent glory. Enjoy. And please, spread this video as far and as wide as you can. Libraries are important.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"345\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/MDi5JtS1H-g\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>"

This happens as I sing  it out to different audiences and find out which bits work, which bits are hard to sing and all the other little details that you only find out when there&#8217;s a living, breathing, listening and (hopefully) singing audience in front of you.</p>\n<p>It turns out that the same things happens with songs I&#8217;ve written.</p>\n<p>The biggest stumbling block of the original version is the last line of the first verse:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My wife met Pippi Langstumpf, I met Paddington the Bear</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Someone on the comment thread suggested:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Heidi, Pippi Longstocking and Paddington the Bear</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which is fine, except that means singing &#8216;PIPpi LONGstockING&#8217;, and I&#8217;m not happy with putting the emphasis on the <span class=\"caps\">WRONG</span> sylLABles if I can possibly help it. In the revised version, I think I&#8217;ve cracked it. The line is now:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The daughter of a pirate king and Paddington the bear</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which is <em>much</em> easier to sing and follows the rest of the verse by being a more oblique reference to the character. If you know who Pippi is, then it&#8217;s obvious who I&#8217;m singing about. If you don&#8217;t, then maybe I&#8217;ve piqued your curiosity.</p>\n<p>The first recording also had two slightly different tunes for the verses, this version has settled on just the one.</p>\n<p>And, for people who care about that sort of thing, this was recorded with a click track at 110bpm rather than speeding up over the course of the song, which should make life a little easier for anyone taking part in Rabid Gravy&#8217;s <a href=\"http://blog.rabidgravy.com/making-music-to-save-our-libraries\">project</a> to remix and rerecord different versions of the song.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re concerned about Library closures, a good place to start is <a href=\"http://www.voicesforthelibrary.org.uk/\">Voices for the Library</a>. If you&#8217;re on twitter, you might also start following <a href=\"http://twitter.com/ukpling\">@ukpling</a>. If you&#8217;re not concerned about library closures, why on earth did you read this far, and what kind of excuse for a human being are you?</p>"

Frankly, instrumentation scares me, I&#8217;m much happier singing unaccompanied but I realise I&#8217;m in a minority on this.</p>\n<p>When you sing it, try making the song your own by changing things to suit your own. Julie Chilton&#8217;s posted an alternate first verse in the comments, but the world is the mollusc of your choice.</p>\n<p>The &#8216;I&#8217; in the song, isn&#8217;t <em>quite</em> me and it isn&#8217;t quite Gill either. Most importantly, both of us grew up in houses where no book was out of bounds. Our fathers used to take us to our respective local libraries (Lewisham for Gill, Doncaster Central and then Bawtry for me) every week or so on a Saturday morning. As soon as I was old enough, I&#8217;d ride my bike from our home in Scrooby to Bawtry with a carrier full of books hanging off the handlebars. Bawtry is currently in the crosshairs of Doncaster&#8217;s idiot mayor &#8211; the bloke who suggested getting kindles for everyone instead &#8211; along with 13 other libraries in the district.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a revised version of the recording with additional notes at: http://www.bofh.org.uk/2011/04/04/a-child-of-the-library-revised, or just press play:</p>\n<p><object height=\"81\" width=\"100%\"> <param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F13031396\"></param> <param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param> <embed allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"81\" src=\"http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F13031396\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed> </object>  <span><a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/pdcawley/child-of-the-library-revised\">Child Of The Library (Revised)</a> by <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/pdcawley\">pdcawley</a></span></p>\n<h5>August 9th 2011</h5>\n<p>I&#8217;ve updated the lyrics here to reflect what I sing now.

Somehow there are companies out there selling very high end, and \"provably secure\" cryptography gear, all based on fundamental principles of quantum mechanics. Yet, despite being <em>fundamentally</em> unbreakable, there have been quite a few publications on more-or-less practical ways for Eve to eavesdrop on people whispering quantum sweet-nothings in darkened rooms.</p>\n<p>As a bemused onlooker, I jumped on the TGV train from Paris to journey to the heart of quantum key distribution (QKD): Geneva. Geneva is where QKD was deployed in real-world demonstrations, it is the base of Id Quantique, a company that specializes in quantum physics based security products, and it is home to University of Geneva's <em>GAP-Optique</em>, a power house of quantum optics research.</p>\n<p>My goal was to discover what all the fuss was about. Who buys a QKD distribution system? Why do they bother? If QKD becomes ubiquitous, where is the battle between white and black hats going to be played out, and how will that battle change?

Originally started as a small gathering of Dungeons &amp; Dragons co-creator Gary Gygax’s friends, GenCon now finds itself the capstone event amidst a kind of golden age for so-called hobby games. Board gamers, role-playing gamers, LARPers, and war gamers all sit shoulder to shoulder in its massive play spaces, while buskers vie for their attention on the nearly 400-strong vendor floor. Boosted by satellite events like PAX and the un-closeting of an emboldened gamer population at large, there’s plenty of room for continued growth.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">Buried inside the sacred tome that is GenCon’s annual program, amidst the thousands of play sessions of new and old properties, was a listing for an entirely new event—a keynote presentation. To no one’s surprise, the keynote presentation was given by Wizards of the Coast (WotC). Their goal?

Call them “The Edition Wars.” OD&amp;D begat AD&amp;D which begat Third Edition, and with each transition came, if not enmity within the ranks, then perhaps the kind of gentle chiding that siblings have for one another across the dinner table.

This seems easy at first. When the game begins, you invariably find yourself on a sandy beach somewhere, and a bit of experimentation quickly yields the knowledge that you can affect your environment by punching things. You can punch trees to break them apart and collect wood, for instance, which you can use to make tools, which you can use to gather more materials, which you can use to make more things. You'll just be getting the hang of the basic mechanics when night falls—and the zombies and skeletons and spiders and creepers come out to collect your soul.</p>\n<p>As the game grew more popular, Persson (known to fans by his in-game handle \"Notch\") hired staff and eventually turned over daily programming duties to other folks. These days, Notch spends his days developing other games and being <a href=\"http://penny-arcade.com/report/editorial-article/notch-interview\">interviewed</a> by famous Internet journalists, while <em>Minecraft</em> thrives on multiple platforms including PC, Mac, Linux, and XBox 360.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/09/blocks-with-friends-how-to-run-your-own-minecraft-server/\">Read 65 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/09/blocks-with-friends-how-to-run-your-own-minecraft-server/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/gF8kfzrsazCB0-hzE8UhHqMiCEY/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/gF8kfzrsazCB0-hzE8UhHqMiCEY/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/gF8kfzrsazCB0-hzE8UhHqMiCEY/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/gF8kfzrsazCB0-hzE8UhHqMiCEY/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/9tqTYR55SPM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

For every characteristic that we associate with a particular sex, the animal kingdom harbors at least one surprising exception; concepts that we believe are inextricably linked are uncoupled, and even reversed, in other species.</p>\n<p>Our sex exerts an incredible influence on our lives, influencing anatomy, appearance, behavior, and countless other traits.

Available both as part of Server 2012 and as a free (as in beer) standalone installation, the third generation of Hyper-V brings with it a collection of features that largely commoditize the sorts of things you’ve gotten used to having to pay extra for. There are even a few features you couldn’t do <em>at all</em> with other hypervisors (like live migration of a server from one server to another with no shared storage between the two).</p>\n<p>Hyper-V supports a host of high-availability and “resiliency” features, such as off-site replication of servers. And it does many of those things as well or better than offerings from VMware and Citrix—regardless of whether you’re virtualizing Windows servers, Windows desktops, or Linux. And then there’s the free part: while the licenses for Windows Server itself are tied to a specific set of hardware, other operating systems can be hosted on the standalone Hyper-V server and managed as part of the same environment. All with the same sort of manageability.</p>\n<p>In this first look at Hyper-V 2012, we look at some of the high points of the hypervisor and its management environment from the perspective of a small to mid-sized enterprise. While many of the new features have been available on other virtualization platforms for some time, Hyper-V matters largely because of the way that Microsoft has tied them all up in a relatively simple and inexpensive package. This could potentially save organizations a significant amount of money—while preserving their sanity as well.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/09/first-look-hyper-v-2012-targets-vmwares-air-supply/\">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/09/first-look-hyper-v-2012-targets-vmwares-air-supply/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/qGk5X-tfvdXUa6UX_AQ5sUk8DJc/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/qGk5X-tfvdXUa6UX_AQ5sUk8DJc/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/qGk5X-tfvdXUa6UX_AQ5sUk8DJc/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/qGk5X-tfvdXUa6UX_AQ5sUk8DJc/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/FixehGsitwM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

Behind Door Number One sits a free-to-watch service that uses off-the-shelf technology and that buffers just enough of each show to put the live stream on the Internet. Behind Door Number Two lies a subscription service that requires custom-designed hardware and makes dozens of copies of each show. Which sounds easier to build—and to use?

That technology, supplied by a subsidiary of the French IT firm Bull, used a technique called deep packet inspection (DPI) to capture e-mails, chat messages, and Web visits of Libyan citizens.</p>\n<p>The fact that the Qaddafi regime was using deep packet inspection technology wasn’t surprising. Many governments have invested heavily in packet inspection and related technologies, which allow them to build a picture of what passes through their networks and what comes in from beyond their borders. The tools secure networks from attack—and help keep tabs on citizens.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.narus.com/\">Narus</a>, a subsidiary of Boeing, supplies “cyber analytics” to a customer base largely made up of government agencies and network carriers. Neil Harrington, the company’s director of product management for cyber analytics, said that his company’s “enterprise” customers—agencies of the US government and large telecommunications companies—are ”more interested in what's going on inside their networks” for security reasons. But some of Narus’ other customers, like Middle Eastern governments that own their nations’ connections to the global Internet or control the companies that provide them, “are more interested in what people are doing on Facebook and Twitter.”</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/08/big-brother-meets-big-data-the-next-wave-in-net-surveillance-tech/\">Read 63 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/08/big-brother-meets-big-data-the-next-wave-in-net-surveillance-tech/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/C0feMutPRInXFsJpDul1xmeaaoU/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/C0feMutPRInXFsJpDul1xmeaaoU/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/C0feMutPRInXFsJpDul1xmeaaoU/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/C0feMutPRInXFsJpDul1xmeaaoU/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/3w0FQVI8TU8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

Since the first models hit the market, the Ultrabook moniker—originally created to denote a thin, light laptop using a low-voltage Intel processor and a fast solid-state drive—has come to encompass just about any laptop that is thinner or lighter than usual.</p>\n<p>Acer's Aspire Timeline M5-481TG is one such computer. Acer officially refers to it as an Ultrabook, but its 14\" screen and 4.3 pound weight definitely push the limits of the term. That said, the M5 uses the extra size and weight to its advantage, packing a dedicated graphics processor and a DVD burner into a relatively thin-and-light frame. It's not the fastest gaming notebook on the market, and it's definitely not the thinnest and lightest. But can this laptop's specs make it a solid all-rounder, or does the approach simply produce a chunky, compromised Ultrabook?</p>\n<table class=\"specifications center\" width=\"500\">\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\" colspan=\"2\">Specs at a glance: Acer Aspire Timeline Ultra M5-481TG</th>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<th>Screen</th>\n<td>1366x768 at 14\" (112 ppi)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<th>OS</th>\n<td>Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<th>CPU</th>\n<td>1.7GHz Intel Core i5-3317U (Turbo boost up to 2.6GHz)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<th>RAM</th>\n<td>4GB 1333MHz DDR3 (officially supports up to 6GB, reports say it can support 10GB)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<th>GPU</th>\n<td>1GB NVIDIA GeForce GT 640M LE and Intel HD Graphics 4000 (switchable)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<th>HDD</th>\n<td>2.5” 5400RPM 500GB hard drive, 20GB SSD</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<th>Networking</th>\n<td>Gigabit Ethernet, dual-band 802.11n, Bluetooth 4.0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<th>Ports</th>\n<td>2x USB 3.0, HDMI, card reader, headphones</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<th>Size</th>\n<td>13.4\" x 0.8\" x 9.6\"</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<th>Weight</th>\n<td>4.30 lbs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<th>Battery</th>\n<td>3-cell 4850 mAh Li-ion</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<th>Price as reviewed</th>\n<td><a href=\"http://us.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/model/NX.M27AA.001\">$779.99</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<th>Other perks</th>\n<td>Webcam, backlit keyboard, DVD burner, 1 year warranty</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Design and build quality</h2>\n<p>The M5 is constructed entirely from plastic—the lid, display bezel, and top case are all dark gray and have a faux-brushed metal look, while the bottom of the laptop is a black, textured matte plastic. There's a bit of flexing in the top case, especially in the lid, but the laptop has a nice dense feel to it and doesn't feel overly cheap in spite of its construction. The M5 is of a uniform, 0.8\" thickness throughout, with none of the tapering seen in many Ultrabooks, and the laptop's lid sits flush with its slightly raised LCD hinge when closed. The hinge itself feels sturdy, but not so stiff that you can't open the laptop without holding the bottom down.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/trying-to-have-it-all-acers-timeline-m5-gaming-ultrabook/\">Read 35 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/trying-to-have-it-all-acers-timeline-m5-gaming-ultrabook/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/QBnChJFy55yrEvKPOY-GQ89y3g8/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/QBnChJFy55yrEvKPOY-GQ89y3g8/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/QBnChJFy55yrEvKPOY-GQ89y3g8/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/QBnChJFy55yrEvKPOY-GQ89y3g8/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/o0lGdZeWgcg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

Well, \"watching\" per se. You're actually staring into the ever-present glow of your smartphone ready to read an urgent memo from your boss; hoping to next check live stats because you're <em>so close</em> to finally winning a fantasy football game.</p>\n<p>Then, tragedy strikes—your phone is showing five bars, but it's slowed to a crawl. You check the available WiFi networks: \"Free Stadium WiFi.\" You select, but deep in your heart you know there's no chance of connecting up here, 100 feet below the cloud cover. And that's when you come to a horrific realization: I'm going to have to put my phone in my pocket and <em>actually</em> pay attention.</p>\n<p>It's a “scary” thought for sports fans: Someday soon, the wireless network at your favorite team’s stadium could be so congested you’ll actually be forced to—gasp!—watch the game you paid a ticket for. People like Katee Panter, VP of infrastructure technology at Madison Square Garden in New York, fear growing use of smartphones and tablets to surf the Web or stream video will make it difficult to provide cellular and WiFi connections for everyone. Teams are taking advantage of fans' handheld devices by building apps to serve up interactive experiences or provide an easier way to order food and beverages. But delivering wireless Internet connections to tens of thousands of densely packed people is no easy technological feat.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/features/2012/08/why-your-smart-device-cant-get-wifi-in-the-home-teams-stadium/\">Read 27 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/features/2012/08/why-your-smart-device-cant-get-wifi-in-the-home-teams-stadium/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/t_liO1P8J2caH3JyrMGeIDQQnk0/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/t_liO1P8J2caH3JyrMGeIDQQnk0/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/t_liO1P8J2caH3JyrMGeIDQQnk0/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/t_liO1P8J2caH3JyrMGeIDQQnk0/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/KIAxQJTRi7o\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

7e5aa33c-20f8-f693-22ac-7b531e0db540.description	"<p>We had such hopes for Intel's Ultrabook movement. With the first clarion call, we <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2011/09/ultrabook-intels-300-million-plan-to-beat-apple-at-its-own-game/\">dreamed of a PC</a> that would shatter Apple's monopoly on high-quality ultra-thin-and-light notebooks. In the first year of the Ultrabook campaign, we saw a few possible claimants to the throne, but in general, each entry was more disappointing than the last. The machines became notorious for using workarounds like larger screens (a 14-inch monitor in a 13-inch body!) and hard disk drives with flash caches (rather than actual solid-state drives) to skirt Intel's Ultrabook speed and size requirements.</p>\n<p>Nearly a year after Intel launched the initiative, manufacturers have finally taken the Ultrabook specs to heart. Lenovo's ThinkPad X1 Carbon reflects what we feel is the <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/01/ultra-in-name-only-the-failures-of-intels-ultrabook-rules/\">true spirit of an Ultrabook</a>: a light, thin body with powerful internals. Lenovo gets it. At long last, PCs have a real shot at the segment Apple has been dominating for years with the MacBook Air.</p>\n<div class=\"image center full-width\" style=\"width:640px\"><img src=\"http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/thinkpad_x1_carbon_keyboard.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"508\"></div>\n<h2>The touch, the feel of rubberized silicone</h2>\n<p>First, the waifish body: at a base 2.99 pounds, 0.31 inches at its thinnest point, and 0.74 inches at its thickest, the X1 Carbon has similar dimensions to the MacBook Air (2.96 pounds and 0.68 inches at its thickest). But that's the 13-inch MacBook Air; the X1 Carbon actually has a 14-inch 1600×900 screen packed into a \"13-inch body,\" as hardware manufacturers are recently so fond of saying. The extra display area is noticeable compared to a 13-inch computer, yet our backs and shoulders don't suffer any more for the extra real estate. And when we say 13-inch body, we mean it; the X1 Carbon is 13.03 inches wide by 8.9 inches deep, comparing well with the MacBook Air at 12.8 by 8.94 inches.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/a-worthy-ultrabook-appears-the-thinkpad-x1-carbon-reviewed/\">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/a-worthy-ultrabook-appears-the-thinkpad-x1-carbon-reviewed/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/EKJppYCqOw0fihWnleJoA8zArOg/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/EKJppYCqOw0fihWnleJoA8zArOg/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/EKJppYCqOw0fihWnleJoA8zArOg/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/EKJppYCqOw0fihWnleJoA8zArOg/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/yu-uBCAu2t8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

The same variety that makes it possible for you to find a laptop specifically designed to manage both your neon geranium business <em>and</em> your online polka-streaming startup also means that the market is flooded with laptops that <em>aren't</em> tailored to your particular needs. It's much more work than it's worth to educate yourself on every tiny difference between laptop A from manufacturer X and laptop B from manufacturer Y.</p>\n<p>We're here to help. To give you some guidance in this back-to-school season, we've set up three basic laptop categories. <strong>Basic laptops</strong> emphasize price over performance or size; <strong>gaming laptops</strong> emphasize performance over price or size; and <strong>lightweight laptops</strong> emphasize size over price or performance. Each is further subdivided into price ranges.</p>\n<p>Every category features picks that, in our view, represent some of the best machines available now. In most cases, we've also included a few alternatives in case something about our main pick was a dealbreaker for you. With a little luck, you'll be able to find something tailored to your needs and budget.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/the-ars-pc-laptop-buying-guide-back-to-school-edition/\">Read 54 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/the-ars-pc-laptop-buying-guide-back-to-school-edition/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/4knzOxlKIRQEpXa-PjjIk2rbdOA/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/4knzOxlKIRQEpXa-PjjIk2rbdOA/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/4knzOxlKIRQEpXa-PjjIk2rbdOA/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/4knzOxlKIRQEpXa-PjjIk2rbdOA/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/azITQy1EzUw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

But the young innovator felt isolated. \"Computers were not as popular as they are now,\" Tunkelo said, and few schools had one.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/business/2012/08/experiments-in-airborne-basic-buzzing-computer-code-over-fm-radio/\">Read 32 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/business/2012/08/experiments-in-airborne-basic-buzzing-computer-code-over-fm-radio/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/3h6_lWsn5uYDqGolril3YRHN-Ys/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/3h6_lWsn5uYDqGolril3YRHN-Ys/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/3h6_lWsn5uYDqGolril3YRHN-Ys/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/3h6_lWsn5uYDqGolril3YRHN-Ys/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/gyXhJG4wHVA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

But the prosecutors sitting across the courtroom from him didn't work for the Crown—they were lawyers for the movie studio trade group Federation Against Copyright Theft (FACT).</p>\n<p>FACT, not public officials in the UK, was the driving force behind Vickerman's prosecution. Indeed, FACT effectively took on the role of a private law enforcement agency. Private investigators hired by FACT first identified Vickerman as the administrator of STC and built the case against him. His assets were frozen at FACT's request by a government agency—which was itself funded by FACT. And when the UK's public prosecutors decided not to press charges against Vickerman at all, FACT initiated a criminal prosecution on its own dime.</p>\n<p>This is a new development for anti-piracy efforts. Organizations like the MPAA, RIAA, IFPA, and FACT have long lobbied law enforcement officials to prosecute \"rogue sites\" and have provided them with information and logistical support to do so. But public prosecutors generally have the final say on who will be indicted. In the Vickerman case, the public prosecutors concluded that there wasn't enough evidence to merit prosecution. FACT disagreed and invoked what one lawyer told us is an \"archaic right\" for a private organization to bring criminal prosecutions against other private parties.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/08/private-justice-how-hollywood-money-put-a-brit-behind-bars/\">Read 44 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/08/private-justice-how-hollywood-money-put-a-brit-behind-bars/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/dLRxJ5Go-chXQxIhSNJvsqH5wZY/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/dLRxJ5Go-chXQxIhSNJvsqH5wZY/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/dLRxJ5Go-chXQxIhSNJvsqH5wZY/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/dLRxJ5Go-chXQxIhSNJvsqH5wZY/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/LKpXpY0nyuA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

With the rise of whole new classes of \"personal computers\"—tablets and smartphones—it's worth updating all the numbers once more. And when we do so, we see something surprising: the adoption rates for our beloved mobile devices absolutely blow away the last few decades of desktop computer growth. People are adopting new technology faster than ever before.</p>\n<p>Humans are naturally competitive creatures. Not only do we compete with each other for money and power, but we form strong allegiances to various tribes. Whether it's a favorite sports team or a chosen computing platform, we passionately cheer when they win and feel a punch in our guts when they lose. Companies know this, and they will trumpet their successes and quietly hide their failures. But is it any more important to want one multi-billion dollar company to win over another than it is to root for one arbitrary multi-million dollar athlete? Is it anything more than cheerleading?</p>\n\n<p>Well—there's certainly plenty of cheerleading, but tracking the rise of fall of market share over time has more serious uses, too. Software developers need to keep track of market share so they can decide where to invest their resources. Consumers may then choose platforms based on software availability. Platforms can live—and sometimes die—by market share. The successes and failures of one generation of platforms affect the next, and ultimately this has an impact on everyone's digital lives.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/business/2012/08/from-altair-to-ipad-35-years-of-personal-computer-market-share/\">Read 50 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/business/2012/08/from-altair-to-ipad-35-years-of-personal-computer-market-share/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/flSZkEK2_wLwv67uQ_nkbYUcorc/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/flSZkEK2_wLwv67uQ_nkbYUcorc/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/flSZkEK2_wLwv67uQ_nkbYUcorc/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/flSZkEK2_wLwv67uQ_nkbYUcorc/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/jYz2MMZLQqY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

It responds by speaking back to the user and displaying relevant information. You can use the speech interface to dictate an e-mail or text message, search Google, perform a calculation or unit conversion, get the definition of a word, get a stock quote, search the platform’s built-in addressbook, set an alarm, play a song, get travel directions, get the current weather conditions in a region, or launch an application. The range of supported commands and queries is comparable to Siri's.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/review-androids-google-now-can-teach-siri-a-few-tricks/\">Read 43 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/review-androids-google-now-can-teach-siri-a-few-tricks/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/wI2qe0RCBRrNx0yq0Nt41V6Eahc/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/wI2qe0RCBRrNx0yq0Nt41V6Eahc/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/wI2qe0RCBRrNx0yq0Nt41V6Eahc/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/wI2qe0RCBRrNx0yq0Nt41V6Eahc/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/nkwuBC0j31Y\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

Its absence was brutally disappointing; thankfully, Tim Cook broke his vow of secrecy to reassure us that a new Mac Pro will arrive in 2013. But for filmmakers compressing hours of 4K footage or school labs in need of new Maya machines, that’s a long time to wait—perhaps too long. Since I was also in the market for a machine to help out with my V-Ray renders, I decided that the time had come to evaluate my alternatives. The current Westmere-based Mac Pro line is definitely out of sync with what’s available elsewhere, and it is no longer competitive from a price-to-power standpoint.</p>\n<p>I have heard it said that Dell, HP, and Apple split the workstation market pretty much three ways; whether or not this is true, it did seem worth taking a look at how the other big boys’ hot-rods rolled. The HP Z820 and Dell Precision T5600 are both monstrous dual-socket Intel E5-2665 Xeons clocked at 2.4GHz and, if I had to guess, I’d say that they are much like what would have replaced the dual Westmere Xeon 2.66GHz Mac Pro <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/2010/10/tri-screen-cpu-monitor-ars-reviews-the-12-core-2010-mac-pro/\">that I reviewed in 2010</a>.</p>\n<p>Of course, you can still build your own workstation, but I’m writing this for an audience who needs top-tier support and doesn’t want to chase six different companies when something goes wrong. I have my own overclocked 3930K gaming rig dual-booting Linux and Windows, but as I’ve pointed out countless times in the comments section of my Mac Pro reviews, a workstation needs to do one thing: keep working. Vendor support remains key to making this happen.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/as-mac-pro-stagnates-pc-workstations-muscle-ahead/\">Read 93 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/as-mac-pro-stagnates-pc-workstations-muscle-ahead/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/fn_wIMbfc-7y7iitMeT2152bWG0/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/fn_wIMbfc-7y7iitMeT2152bWG0/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/fn_wIMbfc-7y7iitMeT2152bWG0/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/fn_wIMbfc-7y7iitMeT2152bWG0/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/Xuqtj50gGio\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

Venus is similar in size and mass to our planet, but its broiling hot surface temperature and sulfuric acid rain put some hard limits on comparisons; other interesting worlds lack atmospheres or are frozen over. But Mars has potential. Despite the thin carbon dioxide atmosphere and low surface gravity (if you weigh 150 pounds on Earth, you'd only weigh 56 pounds on Mars), the planet is just enough like Earth to offer the promise of habitability—whether in the future by humans, or in the past or present by native life forms.</p>\n<p>So it's no surprise that Mars was an exploration target from the very beginning of spaceflight. The first missions sent to Mars by the Soviet Union began in 1960, a scant three years after Sputnik. The first successful flyby came in 1965 with NASA's Mariner 4, and the first successful landing was the Soviet Mars 3 in 1971. That lander ceased transmission soon after touchdown, which is common on the Red Planet—Wikipedia's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration_of_Mars#Timeline\">timeline of Mars exploration</a> is a sobering read for that very reason.</p>\n<p>The many failures make the successful landings look even more amazing. With the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover, known as Curiosity, arriving on-planet August 6, we're going to take a look back at the landers and rovers that brought us to today.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/2012/08/mars-needs-rovers-and-its-getting-a-big-one/\">Read 26 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/2012/08/mars-needs-rovers-and-its-getting-a-big-one/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/7If4mo7pHL6NUwUJCl060HfIlag/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/7If4mo7pHL6NUwUJCl060HfIlag/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/7If4mo7pHL6NUwUJCl060HfIlag/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/7If4mo7pHL6NUwUJCl060HfIlag/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/RgP-rDJvKi0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

Founded by the former senior VP of Apple's iPod division, Tony Fadell, along with his partner Matt Rogers, Nest Labs set out to create what is essentially the iPod of the thermostat world. The round, user-friendly device was initially met with excellent reviews, but were these based in reality or were they the result of some Apple-like hype?</p>\n<p>I like to think of myself as somewhat of a thermostat nerd. (Listen, it doesn't sound very exciting because it's not, but I like them). I am fascinated by thermostats and their usability, but I also don't like to spend too much money on them—unless the extra cost is worth it. Friends and Twitter followers have long asked me to evaluate higher-end thermostats, and I'm always examining the thermostats at other people's houses. So when I finally had the opportunity to install a Nest, I jumped at it.</p>\n<p>Now that I've been using the Nest for several months, I have a pretty good feel for its strengths and weaknesses—at least compared to what is typically available on the market. Is the Nest really worth the $250 it costs to obtain one, just so you can have a fancier way of turning the temperature up and down? I think so—especially if you're the \"convenience oriented\" type (that's PC for \"lazy\").</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/a-thermostat-that-learns-three-months-with-the-nest/\">Read 44 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/a-thermostat-that-learns-three-months-with-the-nest/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/Jgvmmo8M68VUN6mGvaW8S6RYeLU/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/Jgvmmo8M68VUN6mGvaW8S6RYeLU/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/Jgvmmo8M68VUN6mGvaW8S6RYeLU/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/Jgvmmo8M68VUN6mGvaW8S6RYeLU/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/vdYSbKar1us\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

5f050da8-02d7-a670-00a1-b92fc5d7ff6e.description	"<p>In <a\nhref=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2012/09/features-perl-5-needs-in-2012.html\">Features\nPerl 5 Needs in 2012</a>, I wrote that Perl 5 needs \"compact, native-type data\nstructures\".</p>\n\n<p>While I generally <em>like</em> the polymorphism by which I can read\nexternal data into a data structure and then treat it like the kind of data I\nwant it to be (string, integer, numeric), that flexibility is never free.\nSometimes that flexibility comes at a cost.</p>\n\n<p>I have mixed feelings about the <a\nhref=\"http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/\">Computer Language Benchmarks Game</a>\nwhen used to compare languages, but its microbenchmarks are good targets for\nprofiling data. (I used that strategy to good effect when I worked on Parrot.\nCertainly Parrot could benefit from other performance improvements, but\nremoving low-hanging bottlenecks to maximum performance helped real programs in\nmeasurable ways.)</p>\n\n<p>Earlier this year, I profiled the <a\nhref=\"http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u64q/program.php?test=meteor&lang=perl&id=2\">benchmarks\ngame Perl meteor-contest entry</a>. I didn't expect to find any obvious\ncandidates for optimizing Perl 5, nor did I. I did find results that confirmed\nsome of my expectations.</p>\n\n<p>The program spends a lot of its time manipulating SVs. In fact, about 20% of\nthe runtime of the program goes to this. This is almost exclusively upgrading\nSVs. (An SV is the basic data type in Perl 5. It can store an integer value, a\nstring value, a numeric value, and more.)</p>\n\n<p>Here's the problem. The profile shows that this program performs almost\n65,000 array assignment operations (that's separate from a <code>push</code> or\na <code>splice</code>). This ends up in the guts of the Perl 5 function\n<code>Perl_pp_aassign</code> in <em>pp_hot.c</em>, which eventually gets to\nthis code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>\n        <span class=\"Identifier\">while</span> (<span class=\"Identifier\">relem</span> &lt;= <span class=\"Identifier\">lastrelem</span>) {    /* <span class=\"Identifier\">gobble</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">up</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">all</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">the</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">rest</span> */\n        <span class=\"Identifier\">SV</span> **<span class=\"Identifier\">didstore</span>;\n        <span class=\"Identifier\">assert</span>(*<span class=\"Identifier\">relem</span>);\n        <span class=\"Identifier\">sv</span> = <span class=\"Identifier\">newSV</span>(<span class=\"Constant\">0</span>);\n        <span class=\"Identifier\">sv_setsv</span>(<span class=\"Identifier\">sv</span>, *<span class=\"Identifier\">relem</span>);\n        *(<span class=\"Identifier\">relem</span>++) = <span class=\"Identifier\">sv</span>;\n        <span class=\"Identifier\">didstore</span> = <span class=\"Identifier\">av_store</span>(<span class=\"Identifier\">ary</span>,<span class=\"Identifier\">i</span>++,<span class=\"Identifier\">sv</span>);\n        <span class=\"Statement\">if</span> (<span class=\"Identifier\">magic</span>) {\n            <span class=\"Statement\">if</span> (<span class=\"Identifier\">SvSMAGICAL</span>(<span class=\"Identifier\">sv</span>))\n            <span class=\"Identifier\">mg_set</span>(<span class=\"Identifier\">sv</span>);\n            <span class=\"Statement\">if</span> (!<span class=\"Identifier\">didstore</span>)\n            <span class=\"Identifier\">sv_2mortal</span>(<span class=\"Identifier\">sv</span>);\n        }\n        <span class=\"Identifier\">TAINT_NOT</span>;\n        }</code></pre>\n\n<p>Essentially, for every element to assign to the array, create an entirely\nnew SV, copy in the contents of the old SV (remember, copy semantics!), and\nmove on. That copy operation ends up in <code>Perl_sv_setsv_flags()</code> in\n<em>sv.c</em> which goes through all sorts of gyrations to figure out what type\nof SV the destination should be.</p>\n\n<p>Hold on, didn't that SV already get created? Yes it did, but it's not the\nright type. It might not be big enough to hold the right data from the source.\nAfter some 400 lines of heavily macroed code, it does eventually get the right\ndata.</p>\n\n<p>This program profiles at 1.1 million SV copy operations. In almost 450,000\nof those, the source is <code>undef</code>, so nothing has to happen. In about\n580,000 of those, the source is a plain integer value.</p>\n\n<p>An integer is just data. It doesn't even need an SV if it's only ever\ntreated as an integer. It doesn't need copying, because it can happily remain\nan integer value.</p>\n\n<p>(Yes, if you're concerned that integer could ever overflow the 64 bits\nyou're probably using to store integers, you have to figure out a way to\nupgrade to some sort of arbitrary sided big integer, but that's very\ndoable.)</p>\n\n<p>It turns out that this program spends a lot of time bookkeeping polymorphic\ninternal data structures to store raw integers. That's not counting all of the\ntime spent manipulating the reference counts of raw integers or checking to see\nif you need to do anything special to get or store the value of and from a raw\ninteger.</p>\n\n<p>If it were possible to add type annotations to Perl 5 such that an integer\ncould only ever be an integer and never silently upgraded or an array could\nonly contain integers, it would be possible to update this program to get a\nsignificant amount of speed. A 10% improvement is within the realm of\npossibility, if not more. (I find the program a little too dense to skim and\nexplain at the same time I've been digging into the Perl 5 source code, so I\nwave my hands a little bit.)</p>\n\n<p>Sure, <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?PDL\">PDL</a> is great and I've\nused it effectively, and I'm fully capable of translating this code into XS\nwhere I <em>can</em> perform these manipulations in C where I <em>can</em>\nspecify their types, but crossing the barrier between Perl and PDL can be\ncostly unless you're very clever, and I don't want to write any more C than I\nhave to when Perl could make my job much more convenient.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, adding typed data structures to Perl 5 is a <em>huge</em>\namount of work. It would probably make the already complicated\n<code>Perl_sv_setsv_flags()</code> even more difficult to follow. It would\nrequire rewriting a lot of the internals. It probably depends on attaching\nthings like special behaviors to SV data structures instead of the bodies of\nPerl 5 operations, but that's also a good thing.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, using less memory and going faster is a good\nthing&mdash;and optional typing could open the door to further improvements\nsuch as type-directed optimizations and JITting.</p>\n\n<p>I know I said \"Perl 5 needs this feature in 2012\", but given the amount of work necessary to implement it, I have to back off a little bit to say that it would be nice to have. I hope you can see its value, and I hope it's possible to get it in a version of the Perl language sometime in the next couple of years.</p>"

I've explained <a href=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2012/09/why-perl-5-needs-a-metaobject-protocol.html\">Why Perl 5 Needs a Metaobject Protocol</a> and previously <a href=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2010/10/reinventing-the-axle.html\">Why Perl 5 Needs a Compiler-Free Extension Mechanism</a>.</p>\n\n<p>(If you don't follow the latter link, ask yourself this: would you use Perl\n5 on another VM if you didn't have access to the CPAN? As long as any CPAN\nstack you need includes an XS dependency, you're stuck with the C\nimplementation of Perl 5. Break that dependency and... you see where this is\ngoing.)</p>\n\n<p>If you read a good book on compilers such as <a\nhref=\"http://www.amazon.com/Structure-Interpretation-Computer-Programs-Engineering/dp/0262011530?tag=onyneopre-20\">SICP</a>\nor <a\nhref=\"http://www.amazon.com/Compilers-Principles-Techniques-Tools-2nd/dp/0321486811/?tag=onyneopre-20\">the\nDragon book</a> or even a good book on <a\nhref=\"http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Common-Lisp-Peter-Seibel/dp/1590592395/ref=sr_1_3?tag=onyneopre-20\">Lisp</a>,\nwhich is half of the same thing, you'll eventually run into the idea that you\ncan represent any program in a tree-like structure.</p>\n\n<p>That is to say, any type of computation you wish to perform can be\nrepresented with the right data structure, and that data structure happens to\nbe a tree. Even the venerable \"Hello, world!\" program from K&amp;R is a\ntree:</p>\n\n<pre><code>\nSTATEMENTS\n    / \\\nprint  exit\n  |      |\n\"Hello,  0\n world!\"</code></pre>\n\n<p>(You can represent this tree in a lot of ways, but you get the idea.) As\nSICP explains, the execution model governs how you traverse this tree.\nObviously in this tree, you start at the topmost node, then evaluate leftmost\ndepthfirst until you end.</p>\n\n<p>Even though your processor likely doesn't execute programs by traversing\ntrees and your language's favorite runtime doesn't either, tree structures are\nstill very useful in compilers because they're simple data structures that are\neasy to traverse and produce and manipulate.</p>\n\n<p>This is one reason that fans of Lisp think that Lisp is the ultimate\nprogramming language: you write it by writing this tree directly as source code\nand you can manipulate that tree with source code as if it were a tree, because\nit is.</p>\n\n<p>Many of the rest of us don't want to spend the rest of our lives writing\ntrees by hand, but sometimes we <em>do</em> want to do things with source code\nwithout having to write our own compilers, or at least our own parsers.</p>\n\n<p>Do you know know people say \"<a\nhref=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2009/08/on-parsing-perl-5.html\">Parsing\nPerl is Hard</a>?\" That's because it is. It's not <em>impossible</em>, but the\nPerl 5 parser is a complicated program that mixes up the traditional roles of\nlexing and parsing such that replicating that parse completely is difficult, at\nbest. This is why writing a syntax highlighter for Perl 5 is more difficult\nthan writing one for Lisp.</p>\n\n<p>Do you know how something like <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Devel::Declare\">Devel::Declare</a> works?\nI do, and I don't want to explain it to you. It's not particularly yucky magic,\nbut it's not particularly lovely magic either.</p>\n\n<p>Do you know how Perl 5's optimizer works? It's very limited.</p>\n\n<p>Do you know how Perl 5 source filters work? Not that well! That's why <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Switch\">the Switch module</a> was\ndeprecated in the commit after it became a core module.</p>\n\n<p>Do you know how <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/PPI\">PPI</a> works? Most of\nthe time, very well, but with lots of magic and a few very well understood edge\ncases and not a lot of speed.</p>\n\n<p>All of these problems have the same root cause: it's exceedingly difficult\nto manipulate a Perl 5 program as anything other than text, because the one\nthing that unambiguously understands that program won't share its\nunderstanding.</p>\n\n<p>(That's not <em>entirely</em> true; a few years ago, Larry added a\ncompile-time option to Perl 5 to produce an annotated tree from the\nparser/lexer/compiler, but no one's done much with it.)</p>\n\n<p>A traditional compiler parses a document into a tree structure, then\nmanipulates that tree into at least one and probably more trees and finally\nemits code in another language. It's very patriotic (from tree to shining\ntree). This pattern is no accident; it's the basis of many programs (<a\nhref=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2011/08/everything-is-a-compiler.html\">everything\nis a compiler</a>).</p>\n\n<p>This process is so well understood that patterns exist for treating this\nprocess as a pipeline of tree transformations. As long as you know what kind of\ntree you're going to get and what kind of tree you need to produce, you can add\nyour own transformation step. (If that sounds like <a\nhref=\"http://plackperl.org/\">Plack middleware</a>, there's no coincidence there\neither.)</p>\n\n<p>A formalized AST in Perl 5, representing an official separation between the\nlexing/parsing and execution phases of Perl 5, made available to any and all\nprograms would let people write better syntax highlighters, sure, but also\nbetter IDEs (finding function declarations and associating them with source\ncode would be easier) or debuggers (see again \"finding things) or optimizers (a\npipeline of tree transformations) or transliterations to other VMs or languages\n(still not entirely <em>easy</em> but much more <em>possible</em>) or\nserialization mechanisms (avoid parsing; dump an AST to the execution engine)\nor even little languages atop Perl with their own parsers which compile to the\nPerl 5 AST and run as if they had been Perl all along.</p>\n\n<p>Think about that last point for a moment.</p>\n\n<p>(Think about that last point in the context of syntax weirding mechanisms\nlike <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?MooseX::Declare\">MooseX::Declare</a>, or\nanything which uses string <code>eval</code>.)</p>\n\n<p>Are you sold yet?</p>\n\n<p>Here's the bad news: this is a lot of work. It needs expertise and it needs\nresearch and planning. It needs at least one champion, and it probably needs\nfunding. The first approach will probably fail. It will take longer than anyone\nwants. The only way it will happen is if someone stubborn appears and says\n\"I'll do that!\" or \"I'll fund that!\" and gets just enough support to keep going\npast the difficult parts.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine how amazing it will be, though.</p>"

6a530419-8e72-f4a5-b98d-9ee23c2703ca.description	"<p>In <a href=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2012/09/features-perl-5-needs-in-2012.html\">Features Perl 5 Needs in 2012</a>, I suggested five mostly-not-syntax features that Perl 5 could use right now.</p>\n\n<p>The caveat to all of these features is that 1) someone must <em>code</em>\nthem and 2) someone must <em>maintain</em> them. While p5p has traditionally\ndone a lot with a little, remember that any suggestions or discussions will\nonly make it into a Perl 5 release if enough effort goes into implementation to\nmake them happen. If you want any of these features to happen, contact TPF\nabout donations or volunteer your time and skills to help (even if all you feel\ncomfortable doing is helping to refine the design of a feature, that's\nworthwhile).</p>\n\n<p>I promised to explain these features in more detail. First up is a\nmetaobject protocol for Perl 5. Stevan Little and Jesse Luehrs are working on\n<a href=\"https://github.com/stevan/p5-mop\">a proof of concept MOP for Perl\n5</a>, so this feature is well underway.</p>\n\n<p>If you're not familiar with a metaobject protocol, the book <a\nhref=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Metaobject-Protocol-Gregor-Kiczales/dp/0262610744?tag=onyneopre-20\">The\nArt of the Metaobject Protocol</a> explains everything in extensive detail.\n(It's also a pretty good book about Common Lisp, so if you're interested in a\nsemi-practical theoretical exploration of why computer sciencey things like the\nlambda calculus and well-designed extension mechanisms matter, this is a great\nbook about the design and implementation of a language.)</p>\n\n<p>If you don't want to read ~350 pages right now, the short definition of a\nMOP is <em>an API for interacting with your object system</em>. Classes (if\nyour MOP supports them) are objects. You can define a new class by making\nmethod calls. You can create objects by making method calls. You can define an\nentirely new <em>style</em> of class by creating your own new metaclass with\ndifferent behaviors. This is the reason <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Class::MOP\">Class::MOP</a> predated <a\nhref=\"http://moose.perl.org/\">Moose</a>.</p>\n\n<p>A good MOP provides a great theoretical foundation for a wonderful object\nsystem. Where many of us have defended Perl 5's object system as \"minimal but\neffective and flexible\", a good MOP in the core would let us get rid of\n<code>bless</code> in our code... and have more good features.</p>\n\n<h2>Performance Improvements</h2>\n\n<p>Moose can be slow to start, if you have lots of little classes, all on disk\nin their individual modules. Not only are you doing lots of IO to find and load\nthose classes, but you have to build up all of the classes you've defined in\nmemory through Moose's import mechanism (<code>has()</code> and\n<code>extends()</code> and <code>with()</code> are all function calls) which\ncreates and populates a metaclass behind the scenes.</p>\n\n<p>This happens every time you start your program.</p>\n\n<p>Every MooseX extension you load changes things.</p>\n\n<p>Though some of this happens in XS, where memory use can be smaller (less\nPerl data structure overhead) and speed can be faster (the same algorithm done\nin C instead of something written atop C), much of this happens at the Perl 5\nlevel.</p>\n\n<p>A great MOP could have its own custom data structures and code in the core\nto represent classes and methods and attributes, rather than Perl 5 hashes and\narrays. A great MOP could have its own ops to handle things like introspection\nand dispatch. A great MOP could have parser support to avoid the overhead of\ncalling Perl 5 functions (or crossing the XS boundary) to perform basic\nsetup.</p>\n\n<h2>Simplicity of Alternate Object Systems</h2>\n\n<p>Perl 5's default object system is very flexible for strange people like me\nwho've programmed in far too many languages (and implemented a few) who like\nvarious features of multiple languages and think \"Hey, I know, I'll implement\nthis in Perl 5.\" You bless a reference. You invoke a method. That's it.\nEverything else you can build yourself.</p>\n\n<p>The downside is that you have to figure out how to build it yourself.\nSometimes that means even diving into the source code of Perl 5 <em>itself</em>\nto see how things happen.</p>\n\n<p>A good MOP provides a foundation on which you can provide your own custom\nbehavior. As long as you hew to the protocol it defines, you can do anything\nyou want: make a custom metaclass that allows simple and protected shared\nmemory between workers, provide automatic auditing around specific methods,\nproxy transparently to remote resources, anything.</p>\n\n<p>Better yet...</p>\n\n<h2>Interoperability Between Different Object Systems</h2>\n\n<p>One of the projects I maintain uses Moose heavily. One of its dependencies\npulls in <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Moo\">Moo</a>. The authors of\nboth object systems have gone to great lengths to make sure that both work\ntogether.</p>\n\n<p>With a good MOP in place in the core, you have to go to great lengths\n<em>not to interoperate well with other object systems</em>. The default is\ninteroperability.</p>\n\n<p>(Try that in Perl 5 now, where some of the web programming or IO classes\nbless typeglobs. Oh, you expected a blessed hash? Too bad!)</p>\n\n<h2>Syntactic Improvements</h2>\n\n<p>As I alluded to earlier, a good MOP opens the door for declarative syntaxes\nfor defining classes, methods, and attributes. We might finally get a\n<code>class</code> keyword and a <code>method</code> keyword. This is very nice\nbecause it'll be faster, but also...</p>\n\n<h2>Tool Improvements</h2>\n\n<p>... language keywords the language itself knows make their way into syntax\nhighlighters and static analysis tools and reformatters and refactorers. It's\neasy to get a list of all of the methods in all of the classes in a file when\nit's unambiguous to pick out all of the names of classes in a file because you\n<em>know</em> they all have the <code>class</code> keyword in front of them,\nfor example.</p>\n\n<p>Compare that to today, where anything that looks like a coderef in a\nnamespace is potentially a method or potentially a function and the only way to\nknow is to invoke it, and why bother even trying?</p>\n\n<h2>Current Status</h2>\n\n<p>It's difficult to argue against putting a MOP in the core. Stevan and Jesse\nare working hard on it, but they could use more eyeballs on the tests and\ndesign and certainly more testing on various platforms. If you've been looking\nfor an excuse to contribute to Perl 5.18 or Perl 5.20, this is a great place to\nstart.</p>"

(The Greek gods always punish hubris.)</p>\n\n<p>I have a database table full of users. Let's call that table\n<code>user</code>. A user has one or more roles (from the <code>role</code>)\ntable. A user can be an unverified user, a free user, a subscriber, or an\nadministrator. (Administrators obviously are also subscribers, but you get the\npoint.)</p>\n\n<p>I use <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?DBIx::Class\">DBIx::Class</a>\nfor the database access layer. My <code>User</code> result class has a couple\nof methods which let other model actions query whether the user can perform\nspecific operations. They're <a\nhref=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2011/05/decoupling-testability-and-synthetic-attributes.html\">synthetic\nattributes</a>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>has [<span class=\"Constant\">qw(</span><span class=\"Constant\"> is_admin is_subscriber </span><span class=\"Constant\">)</span>], <span class=\"Constant\">is</span> =&gt; <span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">ro</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span>, <span class=\"Constant\">lazy_build</span> =&gt; <span class=\"Constant\">1</span>;\n\n<span class=\"Statement\">sub </span><span class=\"Identifier\">_build_is_admin      </span>{ <span class=\"Statement\">shift</span>-&gt;find_role_by_name( <span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">admin</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span>      ) }\n<span class=\"Statement\">sub </span><span class=\"Identifier\">_build_is_subscriber </span>{ <span class=\"Statement\">shift</span>-&gt;find_role_by_name( <span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">subscriber</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span> ) }</code></pre>\n\n<p>Obviously the implementation of <code>find_role_by_name()</code> is\nsupremely important. Here's how I originally wrote the code (no sense blaming\nanyone else for this, because <em>I</em> wrote all of the access control code\nmyself.) See if you can catch the bug:</p>\n\n<pre><code><span class=\"Statement\">sub </span><span class=\"Identifier\">find_role_by_name</span>\n{\n    <span class=\"Statement\">my</span> (<span class=\"Identifier\">$self</span>, <span class=\"Identifier\">$name</span>) = <span class=\"Identifier\">@_</span>;\n\n    <span class=\"Statement\">while</span> (<span class=\"Statement\">my</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$role</span> = <span class=\"Identifier\">$self</span><span class=\"Identifier\">-&gt;user_roles-&gt;next</span>)\n    {\n        <span class=\"Statement\">return</span> <span class=\"Constant\">1</span> <span class=\"Statement\">if</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$role</span><span class=\"Identifier\">-&gt;role-&gt;name</span> <span class=\"Statement\">eq</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$name</span>;\n    }\n\n    <span class=\"Statement\">return</span> <span class=\"Constant\">0</span>;\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>As a hint, the <code>user_roles</code> method represents the relationship\nbetween the <code>user</code> table and the <code>role</code> table. That\nmethod returns a DBIC resultset which represents the entries in the table with\na foreign key to the <code>user</code> table.</p>\n\n<p>See the bug yet? It took me a while. The problem is that <em>every\ninvocation of the loop</em> fetches a new resultset. Every invocation of the\nloop fetches only the <em>first</em> result from that resultset.</p>\n\n<p>My tests (yeah, I wrote the tests too, before I wrote this code in fact,\njust like you're supposed to do) didn't catch that because the rest of the code\nonly ever checked for one user role, the administrator role, anywhere else.\nOnly when I added code for the subscriber role did the subscription tests\ntrigger this infinite loop. (Now how abhorred in my imagination is that most\nexcellent jest!)</p>\n\n<p>I wish I could say that I diagnosed the cause immediately. I didn't. I\nstared at the code for far too long, until I had the presence of mind to put a\ndebugging statement in the loop body to print the name of the role.  (Stat\nofficium pristina nomine.)</p>\n\n<p>Here's the corrected code, with a single expression hoisted into a scalar\nvariable where it may endure properly:</p>\n\n<pre><code><span class=\"Statement\">sub </span><span class=\"Identifier\">find_role_by_name</span>\n{\n    <span class=\"Statement\">my</span> (<span class=\"Identifier\">$self</span>, <span class=\"Identifier\">$name</span>) = <span class=\"Identifier\">@_</span>;\n    <span class=\"Statement\">my</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$user_roles_rs</span> = <span class=\"Identifier\">$self</span><span class=\"Identifier\">-&gt;user_roles</span>;\n\n    <span class=\"Statement\">while</span> (<span class=\"Statement\">my</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$role</span> = <span class=\"Identifier\">$user_roles_rs</span><span class=\"Identifier\">-&gt;next</span>)\n    {\n        <span class=\"Statement\">return</span> <span class=\"Constant\">1</span> <span class=\"Statement\">if</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$role</span><span class=\"Identifier\">-&gt;role-&gt;name</span> <span class=\"Statement\">eq</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$name</span>;\n    }\n\n    <span class=\"Statement\">return</span> <span class=\"Constant\">0</span>;\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>I will say this: expecting your test suite to pass in under 30 seconds makes this sort of thing much easier to catch. If I'd had to wait for a continuous integration server to get around to checking this commit, I wouldn't have fixed it as quickly as I did.</p>\n\n<p>Then again, it's easier to debug bugs you never write in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>Oh, and if you catch the literary allusion in the title, here's your prize:\ncongratulations! You might be overeducated. (If you caught the other three\nallusions, have you ever noticed how much Pynchon's <em>V</em> influenced\nStephenson's <em>Cryptonomicon</em>?)</p>"

This specification defines new DOM events that provide information about the physical orientation and motion of a device. Such APIs will let Web developers easily deliver advanced Web user experiences leveraging modern devices' sensors.</p>\r\n<h2>How This Helps Developers</h2>\r\n<p>With the Device Orientation API, developers can explore new input mechanisms for games, new gestures for apps (such as “shake to clear the screen” or “tilt to zoom”) or even augmented reality experiences.

49d62d1b-e48a-310c-2f72-28f64f892909.description	"<p>\r\n\tInternet Explorer 9 introduced support for CSS 2D Transforms. Internet Explorer\r\n\t10 Developer Preview added support for <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/WD-css3-3d-transforms-20090320/\">\r\n\t\tCSS 3D Transforms</a> and <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-animations/\">CSS Animations</a>.\r\n\tBy tapping the power of your GPU and running asynchronously from regular JavaScript,\r\n\tthese IE10 features provide a more performant and flexible alternative to traditional\r\n\tscript-based animations for Web content.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn previous blog posts, we covered <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2012/02/02/css3-3d-transforms-in-ie10.aspx\">\r\n\t\tCSS 3D Transforms</a> as well as <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/11/21/adding-personality-with-css3-transitions-and-animations.aspx\">\r\n\t\t\tCSS Animations and Transitions</a>. In this post, we introduce a more “unconventional”\r\n\tuse case for these technologies by describing the concept of “full-page animations”\r\n\tthat can be used during the navigation process to add fluidity and continuity to\r\n\tbrowsing. Our target is to achieve a seamless browsing experience in which content\r\n\tsmoothly appears into view when the user visits a page and transitions away when\r\n\the clicks on a link or performs a relevant action.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThese effects can be accomplished by transforming the HTML <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>\r\n\telement using CSS Animations. However, this use case presents some considerations\r\n\tthat we felt were worthy of discussion, such as the effect of layout and sizing\r\n\ton transforming <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>, as well as how to appropriately time\r\n\tpage navigations so that they mesh properly with our animations.</p>\r\n<p style=\"background-color: rgb(200, 223, 251); padding: 2px 8px 6px;\">\r\n\tThe code samples in this post use unprefixed CSS markup as supported by IE10 Release\r\n\tPreview; other browsers may require vendor prefixes for the CSS Animations and CSS\r\n\tTransforms properties used.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tTransforming a Page’s Entire Content</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCSS Transforms are defined on the stylistic properties of an HTML DOM Element. For\r\n\texample, the markup for rotating an element 45 degrees along its Z axis would look\r\n\tlike this:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n\t<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">#element</span> {</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">transform</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">rotateZ(45deg)</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>}</code></p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAttaching a transform to the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element of your HTML document\r\n\tworks exactly the same way. So performing in order to declaratively add the same\r\n\teffect to your document’s <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> you could do something like\r\n\tthis:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n\t<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">body</span> {</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">transform</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">rotateZ(45deg)</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>}</code></p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLet’s look at a before-and-after shot of a page when applying a transform to the\r\n\tbody element:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\">\r\n\t<img style=\"max-width: 95%;\" alt=\"Screen shot showing applying a rotateZ(45deg) transform to the body element of a document\"\r\n\t\tsrc=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/5556.fpauc_2D00_image1.jpg\" /><br />\r\n\tApplying a rotateZ(45deg) transform to the body element of a document.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor three dimensional transformations, the CSS Transforms specification defines\r\n\tthe <code>perspective</code> property that can be specified on the parent of the\r\n\telement that we transforming. When transforming the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element\r\n\tof your content, it has to be applied to the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element that\r\n\tresides above it in the DOM hierarchy. Doing so is straightforward:\r\n</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n\t<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">html</span> {</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">perspective</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">500px</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>}</code></p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCombining this with a <code>rotateY(45deg)</code> transform on the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>\r\n\telement yields the following result:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\">\r\n\t<img style=\"max-width: 95%;\" alt=\"Screen shot showing applying a rotateY(45deg) transform to &lt;body&gt; with perspective: 500px set on &lt;html&gt;\"\r\n\t\tsrc=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/1323.fpauc_2D00_image2.jpg\" /><br />\r\n\tApplying a rotate(45deg) transform to &lt;body&gt; with perspective: 500px set on\r\n\t&lt;html&gt;.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe can manipulate the <code>transform-origin</code> property on the body element\r\n\tfor interesting results. Let’s look at a couple of examples:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n\t<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">body</span> {</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">transform-origin</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t50%</span> <span style=\"color: Blue;\">100%</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">transform</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">rotateX(45deg)</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>}</code></p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe above markup sets a rotation along X for the body element while shifting the\r\n\torigin of rotations to the bottom of the element using <code>transform-origin</code>.\r\n\tEffectively this rotates the document’s contents “into” the screen like this:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\">\r\n\t<img style=\"max-width: 95%;\" alt=\"Screen shot showing applying transform: rotateX(45deg) and transform-origin:  50% 100% to &lt;body&gt;\" src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/2728.fpauc_2D00_image3.jpg\" /></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe can also manipulate the <code>perspective-origin</code> property on the root\r\n\telement of our document to achieve an off-axis projection effect. Changing the style\r\n\tfor <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> to:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n\t<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">html</span> {</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">perspective</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">500px</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">perspective-origin</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t90%</span> <span style=\"color: Blue;\">50%</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>}</code></p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOur page now looks like this:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\">\r\n\t<img style=\"max-width: 95%;\" alt=\"Screen shot showing applying perspective: 500px and perspective-origin: 90% 50% to the &lt;html&gt; element\r\n\" src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/6038.fpauc_2D00_image4.jpg\" /></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBy using CSS Transforms, we can easily manipulate the visual appearance of the entirety\r\n\tof our page’s content. Since the usual layout and sizing rules still apply, some\r\n\ttransforms on the body element (particularly ones that use percentage values or\r\n\trely on the <code>transform-origin</code> property) can result in different visual\r\n\teffects depending on the content of our page. Recall our previous <code>rotateX(45deg)</code>\r\n\texample with <code>transform-origin</code> set to <code>50% 100%</code>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBelow you can see the results before and after the transform is applied.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\">\r\n\t<img style=\"max-width: 95%;\" alt=\"Screen shot highlighting the difference in scroll bars before and after the application of a transform under perspective projection\" src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/3806.fpauc_2D00_image5.jpg\" /></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNotice how the content does not actually pivot on the bottom of the window but rather\r\n\tat some point outside of the viewport. This is expected behavior for CSS Transforms:\r\n\tthe <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> is laid out normally, then it is rotated along its\r\n\tbottom edge that is somewhere off screen. You will also notice that the actual foot\r\n\tprint of the content has expanded (take a look at the scroll bars in the “after”\r\n\tpicture) in order to accommodate the transformed content (the fact that we are using\r\n\tperspective projection makes this effect even more pronounced).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo how do we deal with arbitrarily sized content when applying transforms to our\r\n\tbody element? Custom tailoring all content in order to ensure that the size of the\r\n\tbody does not expand more than a certain amount may be unrealistic. Instead, we\r\n\tcan use a simple HTML/CSS pattern that allows us to fix the size of the body element\r\n\tto that of the browser window and append content inside a wrapper <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>.\r\n\tThe following markup achieves just that:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n\t<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">html</span>, <span style=\"color: Maroon;\">body</span>\r\n\t\t\t\t{</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">width</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">100%</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">height</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">100%</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">min-width</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">100%</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">max-width</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">100%</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">padding</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">0</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">margin</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">0</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">overflow</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">hidden</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>}</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 2em\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>&nbsp;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">#Wrapper</span> {</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">position</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">absolute</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">width</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">100%</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">height</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">100%</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">overflow</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">scroll</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>}</code></p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe illustration below shows what happens when a page is scrolled vertically and\r\n\twe apply a <code>rotateY(45deg)</code> transform to the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>\r\n\telement of our document directly (left) and using the wrapper pattern (right):</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\">\r\n\t<img style=\"max-width: 95%;\" alt=\"Screen shot showing what happens when a page is scrolled vertically and a rotateY(45deg) transform is applied to the &lt;body&gt; element under perspective projection, with and without a wrapper CSS/HTML pattern\" src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/3884.fpauc_2D00_image6.jpg\" /></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe direct application of the transform results in a skewed visual result due to\r\n\tthe off-axis projection (since we are no longer looking at the “center” of the body\r\n\telement). Using the wrapper pattern ensures that the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element’s\r\n\t<code>perspective-origin</code> property (<code>50% 50%</code> by default) will\r\n\talways be correctly centered with relation to the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element,\r\n\tgiving us a pleasant visual effect.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBy utilizing the above pattern and setting up CSS Transforms with percentage values\r\n\twhenever possible, we can affect our <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element in consistent\r\n\tways, regardless of the size of its contents.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tFrom Transforms to Animations</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHaving sorted out the intricacies of applying CSS Transforms to the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>\r\n\telement, CSS Animations are the next step. By following the principles described\r\n\tabove, we can create animations that bring our Web content into view (or remove\r\n\tit from view) in interesting ways.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tConsider this basic <code>@keyframes</code> rule:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n\t<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">@keyframes</span> rotateInLeft {</code></p>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"padding-left: 2em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">from</span> {</code></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">transform-origin</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t0%</span> <span style=\"color: Blue;\">0%</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">transform</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">rotateY(180deg)</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<code>}</code></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">to</span> { </code>\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">transform-origin</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t0%</span> <span style=\"color: Blue;\">0%</span>; </code>\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">transform</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">rotateY(0deg)</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<code>}</code></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>}</code></p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen applied to an element, this animation will cause it to rotate on its left side.\r\n\tWhen applied to a <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element that uses our wrapper pattern\r\n\tthe visual result is more interesting. The document will actually rotate from <b>outside</b>\r\n\tof the visible area of the browser window and into full view:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\">\r\n\t<img style=\"max-width: 95%;\" alt=\"Three screen shots in sequence showing the affect of applying the &quot;rotateInLeft&quot; animation\" src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/8508.fpauc_2D00_image7.jpg\" /></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSimilarly, we can compose animations that fluidly remove our Web content from view.\r\n\tFor example, if we wanted our page to disappear into the distance while rotating,\r\n\twe could use something like this:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n\t<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">@keyframes</span> whirlOut {</code></p>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"padding-left: 2em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">to</span> {</code></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">transform</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">scale(0)</span>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span style=\"color: Blue;\">rotateZ(1260deg)</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<code>}</code></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>}</code></p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWith the visual result being:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\">\r\n\t<img style=\"max-width: 95%;\" alt=\"Three screen shots in sequence showing the affect of applying the &quot;whirlOut&quot; animation\" src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/5852.fpauc_2D00_image8.jpg\" /></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSince we can use the full power of CSS Animations to affect the entirety of our\r\n\tWeb content, we have a lot of flexibility in terms of generating these page effects\r\n\t(and we are certainly not limited to just using CSS Transforms). But once we have\r\n\tcomposed the effects that we want to apply to our content, how do we cause them\r\n\tto trigger during the page navigation process?</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tAttaching Animations to &lt;body&gt;</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOur goal is to use trigger animations at strategic times during the browser experience\r\n\tin order to give the appearance of content transitioning into view when a page loads\r\n\tand out of view when the user clicks on a link.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe first intuitive place to add an animation to the body element would be the <code>\r\n\t\tonload</code> JavaScript event. As it turns out however, adding an animation\r\n\twhen <code>onload</code> fires is actually too late. This event actually triggers\r\n\twhen the entirety of the content in our page has finished loading (including any\r\n\timages or other bandwidth-intensive resources). Attaching an animation to <code>onload</code>\r\n\ton a bandwidth-intensive page would result in our content displaying “normally,”\r\n\tfollowed by the animation triggering and re-bringing the content into view. Not\r\n\texactly the effect that we were aiming for.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAlternatively, we could utilize the <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> event that triggers\r\n\twhen the browser has finished parsing the DOM structure of our content (but potentially\r\n\tbefore resources have finished loading). The IE Test Drive <a href=\"http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/HTML5/DOMContentLoaded/Default.html\">\r\n\t\t<code>DOMContentLoaded</code> demo</a> illustrates the difference between these\r\n\ttwo events. However, in cases of complex Web content, a modern browser may choose\r\n\tto perform “progressive” rendering, displaying the page before the entirety of the\r\n\tDOM tree has been loaded. In these situations, the visual result would be similar\r\n\tto the <code>onload</code> scenario.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe optimal place to set up an animation that transitions our page content in view\r\n\tis inline at the top of the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element. This ensures that\r\n\tthe animation will commence right as the content is being rendered (and that the\r\n\tstarting position of the content will be that of the <code>from</code> keyframe\r\n\tof our selected animation). A pleasant side effect of this approach is that the\r\n\tanimation may actually mask any progressive rendering, re-layout or resource loading\r\n\tthat can occur with complex content.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSetting up the animations that transition our content out of view is also interesting.\r\n\tOne could assume that we could attach an <code>onclick</code> handler to all elements\r\n\tof interest in our content (for instance all <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tags) and just\r\n\tset the relevant animation properties (<code>animation-name</code>, <code>animation-duration</code>,\r\n\tetc.) in the callback function. However, if we do not actually <b>delay</b> the\r\n\tnavigation from happening, we will not see our expected fluid transition.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis is a good opportunity to utilize the <a href=\"http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-animations/#AnimationEvent-types\">\r\n\t\tanimation events</a> described in the CSS Animations specification. In particular,\r\n\twe can use the <code>animationend</code> event to detect when the animation has\r\n\tcompleted and then<code> </code>trigger a navigation (by setting <code>window.location.href</code>,\r\n\tfor instance). Thus our <code>onclick</code> will trigger the “remove-from-view”\r\n\tanimation and register a handler for <code>animationend</code> on <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>\r\n\tthat will ensure that the navigation event occurs.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tLive Demo Available</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe’ve created <a href=\"http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Graphics/FullPageAnimations/\">a demonstration\r\n\t\tand tutorial on bringing pages alive with CSS Transforms &amp; Animations</a>\r\n\tthat provide depth and examples beyond what we’ve been able to show here. The tutorial\r\n\titself utilizes full page animations during page navigation that work in <a href=\"http://preview.windows.com/\">\r\n\t\tInternet Explorer 10 on Windows 8</a> as well as recent versions of Chrome and\r\n\tFirefox..</p>\r\n<p>To simply enjoy the page-to-page animations, step through the pages of the tutorial using the “Continue to ...” links in the lower right corner of each page.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAt the end of the tutorial we provide some additional guidance and sample code on\r\n\thow to incorporate these animations with your own Web content.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tConclusion</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCSS Transforms and CSS Animations are two powerful feature-sets that enable richer\r\n\tand more immersive Web experiences. This blog post outlined the considerations of\r\n\tusing CSS Transforms and CSS Animations to bring the entirety of your Web content\r\n\tto life. With a small amount of effort you can create Web pages (even static ones)\r\n\tthat provide a fluid and almost app-like navigation experience.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t—Charilaos “Harris” Papadopoulos, Program Manager Intern, Internet Explorer Graphics</p>\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div><img src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=10340682\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">"

43993e6d-d7a2-be41-5cd9-7c252d14b158.description	"<p>\r\n\tToday two Certificate Authorities (CAs), <a href=\"http://www.symantec.com/theme.jsp?themeid=extended-validation-code-signing\">\r\n\t\tSymantec</a> and <a href=\"http://www.digicert.com/code-signing/ev-code-signing.htm\">\r\n\t\t\tDigiCert</a>, announced the introduction of EV code signing certificates.\r\n\tTheir announcement is a positive development for users and businesses because it\r\n\thelps both sides reduce fraud and increase trust. We want to provide some more details\r\n\tabout what this means for Microsoft’s SmartScreen and the Windows 8 application\r\n\tecosystem in general.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tWindows Store &amp; Windows 8 Apps</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe introduction of the <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsstore/archive/2011/12/06/announcing-the-new-windows-store.aspx\">\r\n\t\tWindows Store</a> and <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh974576.aspx\">\r\n\t\t\tWindows 8 Applications</a> will be a significant opportunity for developers\r\n\tto distribute and monetize their applications. Windows 8 Applications are required\r\n\tto pass the Windows Store developer onboarding and application review process. This\r\n\tprocess is designed to give users confidence in the safety of their purchase while\r\n\talso making the install process as frictionless as possible. Windows 8 applications\r\n\tare not in scope for SmartScreen Application Reputation checks or warnings – these\r\n\tapps are reviewed, code signed, licensed &amp; distributed by the Windows store\r\n\tdirectly.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tDesktop Apps</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDesktop applications remain an important part of the Windows experience and Microsoft\r\n\tremains committed to the safety of the desktop experience and our users. We recognize\r\n\tthat Internet Explorer (IE) isn’t the only way users download applications from\r\n\tthe Internet, so Windows 8 now uses SmartScreen to perform an application reputation\r\n\tcheck the first time users launch applications that were downloaded from the Internet.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis evolution of SmartScreen from IE-only to system wide is a significant improvement\r\n\tfor Windows users. We have seen incredible results with this feature in IE9 (more\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.nsslabs.com/research/endpoint-security/browser-security/socially-engineered-malware-global-q3-2011.html\">\r\n\t\there</a> &amp; <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/05/17/smartscreen-174-application-reputation-in-ie9.aspx\">\r\n\t\t\there</a>). Hundreds of millions of users have avoided malware infections\r\n\tdue to these new experiences and we’re happy to bring this protection to Windows\r\n\tusers, regardless of browser choice. For more details on the IE9 application reputation\r\n\tfeature and the data models read this <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/05/17/smartscreen-174-application-reputation-in-ie9.aspx\">\r\n\t\tpost</a>. For more information on security &amp; safety features in Windows\r\n\t8 (including Windows SmartScreen) read this <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2011/09/15/protecting-you-from-malware.aspx\">\r\n\t\tpost</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe deeper integration of SmartScreen Application Reputation also means that desktop\r\n\tapp developers have an additional motivation to sign their code and establish reputation.\r\n\tWe’ve talked in the past about the importance of digitally signing code for both\r\n\testablishing reputation and proving the authenticity of programs. I’m happy to say\r\n\tthe development community has responded to this call to action. Since the release\r\n\tof SmartScreen Application Reputation in IE9 we’ve seen a 10% global increase in\r\n\tsigned downloads, from 73% at IE9 RTM to &gt;83% today.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAs we’ve discussed in the past, SmartScreen builds reputation for both individual\r\n\tprograms and for the certificate used to sign that code. Code signing is important\r\n\tto our reputation intelligence because this higher level identity allows us to build\r\n\treputation across multiple programs signed by a publisher. It is also important\r\n\tfor publishers because signed programs inherit the reputation of the certificate\r\n\twith which they are signed; this means every program a publisher distributes doesn’t\r\n\tneed to build reputation individually.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tEV Code Signing</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tToday we are announcing our support for an important advance in code signing - the\r\n\tavailability of EV code signing Certificates. We’re also announcing that EV code\r\n\tsigning certificates will integrate with the SmartScreen Application Reputation\r\n\ttechnology in Internet Explorer 9, Internet Explorer 10 and in Windows 8.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMicrosoft has been working with the CA industry over the past year to help make\r\n\tEV code signing certificates available. This code signing standard has a couple\r\n\tof key advancements from a safety and identity perspective. First, they require\r\n\ta more rigorous vetting and authentication process similar to that of EV SSL certificates\r\n\tthat are in use today. This process requires a comprehensive identity verification\r\n\tand authentication process for each developer. Secondly, the EV code signing certificates\r\n\trequire the use of hardware to sign applications. This hardware requirement is an\r\n\tadditional protection against theft or unintended use of a code signing certificate.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrograms signed by an EV code signing certificate can immediately establish reputation\r\n\twith SmartScreen reputation services even if no prior reputation exists for that\r\n\tfile or publisher. Other factors are considered when generating reputation and determining\r\n\tproduct experiences and EV-signed programs will be closely monitored over time.\r\n\tWe think the improvements in the vetting and security of these certificates are\r\n\ta great development for both users and developers.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tStarting today, EV code signing certificates are now being issued by <a href=\"http://www.symantec.com/theme.jsp?themeid=extended-validation-code-signing\">\r\n\t\tSymantec</a> and <a href=\"http://www.digicert.com/code-signing/ev-code-signing.htm\">\r\n\t\t\tDigiCert</a>, and the integration with SmartScreen is already live (IE9,\r\n\tIE10 &amp; Win8).\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDetractors may claim that SmartScreen is “forcing” developers to spend money on\r\n\tcertificates. It should be stressed that EV code signing certificates are not required\r\n\tto build or maintain reputation with SmartScreen. Files signed with standard code\r\n\tsigning certificates and even unsigned files continue to build reputation as they\r\n\thave since Application Reputation was introduced in IE9 last year. However, the\r\n\tpresence of an EV code signing certificate is a strong indicator that the file was\r\n\tsigned by an entity that has passed a rigorous validation process and was signed\r\n\twith hardware which allows our systems to establish reputation for that entity more\r\n\tquickly than unsigned or non-EV code signed programs.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tBest Practices</h2>\r\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">\r\n\tDevelopers should still follow the best practices we’ve suggested in past blog posts.\r\n\tWe have added to that guidance the additional options of distributing apps thru\r\n\tthe Windows Store and the option of EV code signing:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"margin-top: 0;\">\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-top: 1em;\"><b>Distribute your apps through the Windows Store<br />\r\n\t</b>Windows 8 Applications are required to pass the Windows Store developer onboarding\r\n\t\tand application review process.

Digital certificates allow data to be aggregated and assigned to a single\r\n\t\tcertificate rather than many individual programs. Although not required, programs\r\n\t\tsigned by an EV code signing certificate can immediately establish reputation with\r\n\t\tSmartScreen reputation services even if no prior reputation exists for that file\r\n\t\tor publisher. EV code signing certificates also have a unique identifier which makes\r\n\t\tit easier to maintain reputation across certificate renewals. Only Authenticode\r\n\t\tCertificates issued by a CA that is a member of the Windows Root Certificate Program\r\n\t\tcan establish reputation.<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tAt this time, <a href=\"http://www.symantec.com/theme.jsp?themeid=extended-validation-code-signing\">\r\n\t\t\tSymantec</a> and <a href=\"http://www.digicert.com/code-signing/ev-code-signing.htm\">\r\n\t\t\t\tDigiCert</a> are offering EV code signing certificates.</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-top: 1em;\"><b>Don’t sign or distribute malicious code</b><br />\r\n\t\tDistributing code detected as malicious will remove the reputation from a file and\r\n\t\talso any reputation from the associated digital certificate – even if signed with\r\n\t\tan EV code signing certificate.</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-top: 1em;\"><b>Apply for a Windows Logo or Windows 8 Desktop App Certification</b><br />\r\n\t\tLearn more about these programs here:<br />\r\n\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t\t<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/hh749939\">Windows\r\n\t\t\t\t8 Desktop App Certification</a> (required for Windows Store submissions)</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd371701(v=vs.85).aspx\">\r\n\t\t\t\tWindows Logo Program</a></li>\r\n\t\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe’re pleased with the announcement today of the availability of EV code signing\r\n\tcertificates and we’re also happy to be able to bring SmartScreen Application Reputation\r\n\tto a new set of Windows users soon with Windows 8.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t—Jeb Haber, Lead Program Manager, SmartScreen\r\n</p>\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div><img src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=10339518\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">"

26ec8ebd-a068-4d62-de1b-485b93904a0d.description	"<p>We’re pleased to share that three new <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2011/04/webperf\">W3C Web Performance Working Group</a> specifications moved to W3C Candidate Recommendations. Accurately measuring the performance characteristics of Web applications is critical to making the Web faster. In addition, developers need the ability to effectively use the underlying hardware to improve the performance of their applications. Over the last two years, companies including Microsoft, Google, Mozilla, Intel, and Facebook have been working toward these goals through the working group. This is a great example of what’s possible when the industry and community come together through the W3C.</p>\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/navigation-timing/\">Navigation Timing</a>, <a href=\"https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webperf/raw-file/tip/specs/ResourceTiming/Overview.html\">Resource Timing</a>, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-user-timing-20110811/\">User Timing</a> and <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-performance-timeline-20110811/\">Performance Timeline</a> specifications help developers accurately measure Web application performance. The first three specifications provide developers with information related to the navigation of the document, resources on the page, and developer scripts, respectively. The Performance Timeline specification defines a unifying interface to retrieve this timing data. Prior to these API’s it was not possible for developers to accurately measure their site performance.</p>\r\n<p>To ensure these performance metrics are measured in the most accurate way possibly, the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-hr-time-20120313/\">High Resolution Time</a> specification defines a sub-millisecond clock resolution. This interface not only benefits accurate measurements of performance metrics, but also allows better frame rate calculations and synchronization of animations or audio cues.  For the first time developers can measure operations with sub-millisecond accuracy.</p>\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/page-visibility/\">Page Visibility</a>, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/animation-timing/\">Timing control for script-based animations</a>, and <a href=\"http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webperf/raw-file/tip/specs/setImmediate/Overview.html\">Efficient Script Yielding</a> specifications help developers write more CPU- and power-efficient Web applications. The Page Visibility API allows for programmatically determining the current visibility state of the page. Developers can use this data to make better CPU- and power-efficiency decisions, e.g., throttling down activity when the page is in the background tab. The <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> API, from the Timing control for script-based animations specification, allows for creating more efficient JavaScript animations. Finally, the <code>setImmediate</code> API, from the Efficient Script Yielding specification, allows developers to efficiently yield control flow to the user agent and receive an immediate callback, efficiently leveraging the CPU.</p>\r\n<p>In order to ensure Web developers only have to write code once and have it work interoperably in all browsers, the Working Group has worked diligently these last two years to standardize these APIs. The table below shows the maturity level of all the specifications currently being edited in the Working Group.</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><div style=\"display: inline-block; text-align: left;

39daf957-8007-ce1c-c365-2c83456e6791.description	"<p>IE10 in <a href=\"http://preview.windows.com/\">Windows 8 Release Preview</a> adds support for a <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/#constructorBlob\"><code>Blob</code> constructor</a>. We earlier <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2012/01/27/creating-files-through-blobbuilder.aspx\">wrote about</a> and <a href=\"http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/HTML5/BlobBuilder/\">demonstrated</a> IE10&rsquo;s support for a <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/file-writer-api/#idl-def-BlobBuilder\"><code>BlobBuilder</code> interface</a>, an in-progress interface in the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/file-writer-api/\">File API: Writer W3C Working Draft</a>. This interface enables developers to work with files on the client PC. Recently, the W3C working group deprecated the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/file-writer-api/#idl-def-BlobBuilder\"><code>BlobBuilder</code> interface</a> in favor of a new <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/#constructorBlob\"><code>Blob</code> constructor</a>. This post explains the differences between the two.</p>\r\n<h2>Comparing Blob Constructor and BlobBuilder Interface</h2>\r\n<p>Both the <code>Blob</code> constructor and the <code>BlobBuilder</code> interface enable Web developers to create files on the client. The difference is in the syntax. Whereas <code>BlobBuilder</code> requires each portion of the blob to be appended during a separate call to the append method, the <code>Blob</code> constructor can take an array of arguments. Here&rsquo;s how to create a simple text file using both <code>BlobBuilder</code> and the <code>Blob</code> constructor:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: #006400;\">// using the Blob constructor</span></code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">var</span> textBlob1 = <span style=\"color: blue;\">new</span> Blob([<span style=\"color: maroon;\">\"Hello\"</span>, <span style=\"color: maroon;\">\" world!\"</span>], { type: <span style=\"color: maroon;\">\"text/plain\"</span>, endings: <span style=\"color: maroon;\">\"transparent\"</span> });</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 2em;\"><code>&nbsp;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: #006400;\">// using the MSBlobBuilder interface</span></code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">var</span> bb = <span style=\"color: blue;\">new</span> MSBlobBuilder();</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>bb.append(<span style=\"color: maroon;\">\"Hello\"</span>);</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>bb.append(<span style=\"color: maroon;\">\" world!\"</span>);</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">var</span> textBlob2 = bb.getBlob(<span style=\"color: maroon;\">\"text/plain\"</span>);</code></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>The <code>Blob</code> constructor takes two arguments, the array of content to put into the blob and an optional dictionary object which can include two members, <code>type</code> and <code>endings</code>. The array of content for the blob may contain blob objects, text strings or array buffers.</p>\r\n<p>Recent versions of Firefox and Chrome also support the <code>Blob</code> constructor.

84050bf1-7047-1115-ee5c-672c2a70530d.description	"<p>\r\n\tIE10 in <a href=\"http://preview.windows.com/\">Windows 8 Release Preview</a> updates\r\n\tthe <code>responseXML</code> from an <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> to return a native\r\n\tXML document by default. This change applies to IE10&rsquo;s Standards and Quirks\r\n\tdocument modes, making them interoperable with other modern browsers and consistent\r\n\twith a “same markup” approach. Compatibility document modes 5, 7, 8, and 9 are unchanged.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis change may impact sites that were expecting <code>responseXML</code> to contain\r\n\tan MSXML document and depended on MSXML-specific functionality such as <code>selectNodes</code>. In these cases, you may request that IE10 return an MSXML by setting\r\n\tthe <code>responseType</code> member of your <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> object to <code>'msxml-document'</code>. If your code does not depend on MSXML-specific functionality, IE10&rsquo;s native XML document should work for you.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNative XML support in IE9 brought DOM parity to XML and HTML and enabled XML fragments\r\n\tto be inserted and rendered directly within a page (even in HTML). IE9 also simplified\r\n\tconverting between XML and DOM with the addition of <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2010/10/15/domparser-and-xmlserializer-in-ie9-beta.aspx\">\r\n\t\tDOMParser and XMLSerializer</a>. IE10 completes this transition by updating\r\n\t<code>responseXML</code> to return a native XML document.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLike IE9, IE10 previews before the <a href=\"http://preview.windows.com/\">Windows 8 Release\r\n\t\tPreview</a> returned an <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms763742(v=vs.85).aspx\">\r\n\t\t\tMSXML</a> document for <code>responseXML</code>. As a result, retrieving\r\n\ta native document required the additional step of passing <code>responseText</code>\r\n\tto <code>DOMParser</code>.\r\n</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n\t<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">var</span> xhr = <span style=\"color: Blue;\">new</span>\r\n\t\t\t\tXMLHttpRequest();</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">//...</span></code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">var</span> parser = <span style=\"color: Blue;\">new</span>\r\n\t\t\t\tDOMParser();</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">var</span> doc = parser.parseFromString(xhr.responseText,\r\n\t\t\t\t<span style=\"color: Maroon;\">&#39;text/xml&#39;</span>);</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">// &#39;doc&#39; contains a native document\r\n\t\t\t\tin both IE9 and IE10</span></code></p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the Windows 8 Release Preview, IE10 eliminates the need for an additional <code>DOMParser</code>\r\n\tstep by returning a native document directly via <code>responseXML</code>.

bb14534c-affd-656d-a08b-b691db2d595b.description	"<p>\r\n\tThe <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/04/15/the-ie10-user-agent-string.aspx\">\r\n\t\tIE10 user agent string</a> was originally introduced in the first platform preview\r\n\tof IE10. In Windows 8 Release Preview we made two additions to aid server-side feature\r\n\tdetection.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<b>The first addition</b> enables detecting whether a machine has touch-capable\r\n\thardware via a new <code>Touch</code> token. Using this token you can present a\r\n\ttouch-friendly version of your site to users with touch-capable hardware (typically,\r\n\tin the case where your normal site is not touch-friendly). Keep in mind that users\r\n\twith touch-capable hardware may also use a mouse and keyboard. You can see where\r\n\tthis token fits into the user agent string in the examples below.\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-top: 0.5em\">IE10 on a machine without touch-capable hardware:<br />\r\n\t\t<code style=\"margin-left: 0.25in\">Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows NT 6.2;\r\n\t\t\tTrident/6.0)</code></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-top: 0.5em\">IE10 on a machine with touch-capable hardware:<br />\r\n\t\t<code style=\"margin-left: 0.25in\">Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows NT 6.2;\r\n\t\t\tTrident/6.0; <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">Touch</span>)</code></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIf you're detecting touch support client-side, do not sniff the user agent string;\r\n\tuse <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh772144(v=vs.85).aspx\"><code>\r\n\t\tnavigator.msMaxTouchPoints</code></a> instead. If the property exists and returns\r\n\ta value greater than zero, the user’s PC has touch capability. For example:</p>\r\n<div style=\"padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n\t<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">var</span> hasTouch = navigator.msMaxTouchPoints &gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t0;</code>\r\n\t\t</p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<b>The second addition</b> to the IE10 user agent string is a new architecture token\r\n\tfor ARM devices running Windows RT. This complements the existing values for other\r\n\tarchitectures. The examples below show how this compares to a few other configurations.\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-top: 0.5em\">32-bit IE10 on 32-bit Windows:<br />\r\n\t\t<code style=\"margin-left: 0.25in\">Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows NT 6.2;\r\n\t\t\tTrident/6.0) </code></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-top: 0.5em\">32-bit IE10 on 64-bit Windows:<br />\r\n\t\t<code style=\"margin-left: 0.25in\">Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows NT 6.2;\r\n\t\t\t<span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">WOW64;</span> Trident/6.0) </code>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-top: 0.5em\">64-bit IE10 on 64-bit Windows:<br />\r\n\t\t<code style=\"margin-left: 0.25in\">Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows NT 6.2;\r\n\t\t\t<span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">Win64; x64;</span> Trident/6.0) </code>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-top: 0.5em\">IE10 on Windows RT:<br />\r\n\t\t<code style=\"margin-left: 0.25in\">Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows NT 6.2;\r\n\t\t\t<span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">ARM;</span> Trident/6.0) </code>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThese additions apply to both desktop and Metro style IE10 since they expose the\r\n\tsame platform capabilities. We recommend optimizing your site’s experience around\r\n\tthe capabilities of the system (like Touch) through <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2010/04/14/same-markup-writing-cross-browser-code.aspx\">feature detection</a>, rather than\r\n\tbrowser or environment detection.

This security update resolves two privately reported vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer. The vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted Web page using Internet Explorer. An attacker who successfully exploited any of these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights. This security update is rated Critical for Internet Explorer 9 on Windows clients and Moderate for Internet Explorer 9 on Windows servers. For more information, see the <a href=\"http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin/ms12-044\">full bulletin</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Most customers have enabled automatic updating and do not need to take any action. We recommend that customers, who have not enabled automatic updating, enable it (Start Menu, type “Windows Update”). We recommend that administrators, enterprise installations, and end users who want to install this security update manually, apply the update immediately using update management software or by checking for updates using the Microsoft Update service.</p>\r\n<p>—Tyson Storey, Program Manager, Internet Explorer</p>\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div><img src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=10328541\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">"

65a229db-3867-d802-92cf-847816bc4591.description	"<p>The quality and correctness of different browsers’ HTML5 engines continue to vary widely. We continue to contribute to the test suites under development at W3C to further the goal of web platform interoperability and same markup. In total, we have submitted <a href=\"http://samples.msdn.microsoft.com/ietestcenter/\">7573 tests</a> that you can view at the IE Test Center as well. As different browsers improve their same-markup support, we can all realize the promise of HTML5.</p>\r\n<p>The title of this post refers to the <a href=\"http://testthewebforward.org/\">week-end event</a> hosted by Adobe on June 15 and 16 at their San Francisco office. Dozens of volunteers joined W3C experts and members from Adobe, Google, Mozilla, Apple, HP, and Microsoft to learn about Web standards testing, how to write CSS and SVG tests, how to file good bugs, as well as the tools available for test suite management.</p>\r\n<p>The meeting then turned into a test ‘hack-a-thon’ fueled by free drinks and food throughout the day. Volunteers spent most of their Saturday writing new test cases for the <a href=\"http://dev.w3.org/csswg/cssom/\">CSS OM</a>, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transforms/\">Transforms</a>, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-background/\">Backgrounds &amp; Borders</a>, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-exclusions/\">Exclusions</a>, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/\">SVG</a>, and other modules. Participants were then <a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/webplatform/2012/06/20/test-the-web-forward-weekend/\">nominated for several prizes</a>. </p>\r\n<h2>Testing Web Standards</h2>\r\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:0;\">Adobe’s Alan Stearns <a href=\"http://testthewebforward.org/slides/alanstearns/#/\">introduced</a> the participants to the general principles of W3C testing and the role of testing in moving specifications forward. In particular, establishing browsers’ individual pass rate for a given specification is not a goal of W3C test suites. In order for a specification to become a W3C Recommendation the Working Group must prove it can be implemented. In practice this means:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"margin-top:0;\">\r\n<li>Creating a test case for each requirement in the specification (these are known as <i>normative statements</i>)</li>\r\n<li>Verifying that at least two separate implementations pass each test</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Note the difference between ‘at least two browsers must pass the entire test suite’ and ‘at least two browsers must pass each test in the test suite’. Browser testers usually describe this phase as ‘testing the spec’. </p>\r\n<p>But an important side-effect of this testing process is to establish a common interoperable baseline that all browsers can develop and test against. Test suites help find bugs across all browsers and can sometimes identify issues in the spec.</p>\r\n<h2>Writing CSS and SVG Tests</h2>\r\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:0;\">There are three different types of tests:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"margin-top:0;\">\r\n<li><b>Stand-alone tests</b> typically rely on visual verification: <a href=\"http://test.csswg.org/suites/css2.1/20110323/html4/at-import-001.htm\">if a failure condition occurs, red content will show</a>. </li>\r\n<li><b>Reference tests</b> compare <a href=\"http://test.csswg.org/suites/css3-multicol/nightly-unstable/html4/columns-invalid-001.htm\">a test</a> against <a href=\"http://test.csswg.org/suites/css3-multicol/nightly-unstable/html4/reference/columns-toolong-ref.htm\">a visual reference</a> that has no dependency on the feature being tested.  Note that the test includes a link to the reference test against which is should be compared.</li>\r\n<li><b>CSS Object Model tests</b> depend on a JavaScript test harness; they verify that the object model reflects what static style sheets specify. For instance, this <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/MediaQueries/20120229/test_media_queries.html\">CSS media query test</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>W3C’s Doug Schepers covered <a href=\"http://testthewebforward.org/slides/dougschepers/#/\">SVG testing</a> while Adobe’s Rebecca Hauck and Jacob Goldstein provided a <a href=\"http://adobe.github.com/web-platform/presentations/test-the-web-forward-tutorial/index.html#/\">test writing tutorial</a>. Peter Linss, CSS Working Group co-chair, offered a deep dive on the <a href=\"http://testthewebforward.org/slides/peterlinss/ttwf.pdf\">CSS testing framework</a> including the test suite build system and management tools such as Shepherd.</p>\r\n<h2>Filing Good Bugs</h2>\r\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:0;\">Mozilla’s Elika Etemad then gave attendees advice on what makes <a href=\"http://fantasai.inkedblade.net/style/talks/filing-good-bugs/\">a good browser bug report</a>:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"margin-top:0;\">\r\n<li>The issue is specific and reproducible</li>\r\n<li>The build and platform are identified</li>\r\n<li>You have looked for duplicates</li>\r\n<li>It includes steps to reproduce the problem</li>\r\n<li>The expected and actual results are described</li>\r\n<li>If possible, the issue has been reduced i.e. all HTML, JavaScript and CSS that is not necessary to reproduce the problem has been eliminated from the problem page and the remainder attached to the bug.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Building a Test Suite</h2>\r\n<p>Building a test suite is a significant investment. One of the reasons it took a long time for CSS2.1 to reach the Recommendation stage was the size of the specification and the underlying number of requirements to test. The <a href=\"http://test.csswg.org/suites/css2.1/20110323/\">latest version of the test suite</a> contains 9,422 tests. </p>\r\n<p>Microsoft <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2009/01/27/microsoft-submits-thousands-more-css-2-1-tests-to-the-w3c.aspx\">contributed</a> over 7,000 of those tests, and we are continually <a href=\"http://samples.msdn.microsoft.com/ietestcenter/\">contributing more tests for other standard specifications</a>.</p>\r\n<p>In IE10, we have added support for <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh673549(v=vs.85).aspx\">a long list of new standard features across CSS, HTML, SVG and the DOM</a>. We have published some of our testcases for these new features on <a href=\"http://samples.msdn.microsoft.com/ietestcenter/\">our IE Test Center</a>. We will be submitting more, notably around those features <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2012/06/06/moving-the-stable-web-forward-in-ie10-release-preview.aspx\">recently unprefixed in the IE10 Release Preview</a>.</p>\r\n<h2>How You Can Help</h2>\r\n<p>We are excited to be part of the community working towards a more interoperable web. If you want to help move the Web forward, you too can help to drive interoperability higher. You can learn <a href=\"http://wiki.csswg.org/test/css2.1/contribute\">how to contribute tests</a>, or <a href=\"http://wiki.csswg.org/test/review\">review existing tests</a>. More information for those is available <a href=\"http://wiki.csswg.org/test/\">on the CSS WG wiki</a> as well as <a href=\"http://testthewebforward.org/\">on the event page</a>.</p>\r\n<p>We will keep you posted on future events.</p>\r\n<p>—Sylvain Galineau, Program Manager, Internet Explorer and<br/><span style=\"visibility: hidden;\">—</span>John Jansen, Test Lead, Internet Explorer</p>\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div><img src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=10325683\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">"

Radial gradients and linear gradients would be specified with separate property values, <code\r\n\t\tstyle=\"white-space: nowrap;\">linear-gradient()</code> and <code style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">radial-gradient()</code>. Fast forward a couple years and all major\r\n\tbrowsers—Chrome, Firefox, IE10 Platform Preview 1, and Opera—had introduced support for the version of CSS gradients described in the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-css3-images-20110217/\">\r\n\t\tW3C Working Draft of 17 February 2011</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen the Working Draft was closely scrutinized, several changed were suggested and after much discussion the specification was edited to reflect these changes.\r\n\tThe major changes, listed in the table above, improved the old specification by addressing issues of clarity and consistency. For instance, in the old angle coordinate\r\n\tsystem, positive angles increased in a counterclockwise manner. This is in contrast to CSS Transforms and SVG Transforms, where positive angle rotations occur in\r\n\ta clockwise manner. With the specification change, angles that describe CSS gradients are now consistent across other CSS angles and increase in a clockwise manner.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the process of changing gradients’ syntax, compatibility was a recognized concern despite the specification being in a Working Draft stage. Not all cases are\r\n\tcompatible, but much existing content will continue to work. Default values remain the same, so their rendering will be unchanged. For gradient-line direction,\r\n\tthe required “<code style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">to</code>” preposition both adds clarity and changes the valid grammar. Existing content with unprefixed gradients\r\n\tusing the old syntax will be invalid, thereby falling back on the vendor-prefixed version.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tUpdate Your Unprefixed Gradients</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNow that CSS3 Gradients are stable, we encourage you to update your gradients markup to the correct Candidate Recommendation unprefixed gradient syntax. The Internet Explorer 10 Guide for Developers includes <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh673532(v=vs.85).aspx\">full updated documentation</a> of the unprefixed syntax.  You may\r\n\talso remove instances of the <code style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">-ms-</code> prefixed gradients, as IE10 supports the unprefixed version. If you’re using corner\r\n\tkeywords or angles to describe gradient direction, you may want to verify that your gradients still render as desired.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhile vendor-prefixed gradients still work in IE10 and other browsers, adding correct support for unprefixed gradients future-proofs your content.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t—Jennifer Yu, Program Manager, Internet Explorer</p>\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div><img src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=10323746\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">"

56bc5674-5b13-feb4-8037-6755c7d32db3.description	"<p>The <a href=\"http://preview.windows.com/\">Windows 8 Release Preview</a> includes a new power-optimized, touch-friendly Adobe Flash Player. Adobe Flash content on compatible Web sites will now play in Metro style IE10. Metro style IE10 with Flash on Windows 8 enables people to see more of the Web working with high quality, especially compared with the experience in other touch-first or tablet experiences.</p>\r\n<p>On Windows 8, Internet Explorer 10 on the desktop and Metro style IE use the same integrated Adobe Flash Player with no need to download or install an additional player. IE10 on the desktop provides the same full Flash support as previous versions of IE that relied on the Flash Player plug-in from Adobe and continues to support other 3rd party plug-ins. Metro style IE continues to provide no support for 3rd party ActiveX controls or plug-ins. </p>\r\n<p>While any site can play Flash content in IE10 on the Windows desktop, only sites that are listed in the Flash section of the Compatibility View (<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/gg622935(v=vs.85).aspx\">CV</a>) list can play Flash content within Metro style IE. (Being listed in the Flash section does <i>not</i> affect a site’s document mode.) We place sites with Flash content on this list if doing so delivers the best user experience in Metro style IE with those sites. For example, how responsive is the content to touch? Does it work well with the onscreen keyboard? Is it battery-life friendly? Do visual prompts comply with the Metro style user experience guidelines? Sites that rely on capabilities that are not supported within the Metro style experience, for example, Flash rollover events and P2P functionality, and don’t degrade gracefully in their absence are better off running in IE with Flash on the desktop.\r\n<p>Site developers continue to control the content they serve to browsers. Developers can send HTML5 content to Metro style IE or express their preference that Metro style IE prompt users to run their site on the desktop (see details <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2012/01/31/web-sites-and-a-plug-in-free-web.aspx\">here</a>). Developers can also request that their site is considered for addition to the CV list for Flash. Additional technical information and details can be found in the <a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=256383\">document posted on MSDN</a>. These details include how developers can test Flash content on their own sites in Metro style IE and how to submit their sites for consideration for the CV list. The documentation also includes a best practices guide to help developers, designers, and content publishers create experiences with Flash that play well in Metro style IE. </p>\r\n<p>—Rob Mauceri, Group Program Manager, Internet Explorer</p>\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div><img src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=10323065\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">"

4591ad3f-b774-2fe5-a662-b4a48ab2d985.description	"<p>\r\n\tBased on your feedback, we’ve improved how sites can build advanced touch experiences using gesture events in IE10 on the <a href=\"http://preview.windows.com/\">Windows\r\n\t\t8 Release Preview</a>. Earlier we wrote about <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2012/04/20/guidelines-for-building-touch-friendly-sites.aspx\">first steps\r\n\t\t\tWeb developers should take</a> to make sure their sites are touch-friendly and how to build new experiences that work well across input devices, including\r\n\tmulti-touch, using hardware agnostic <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/09/20/touch-input-for-ie10-and-metro-style-apps.aspx\">pointer events.</a>\r\n\tThis post covers IE10’s <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh772076(v=vs.85).aspx\">gesture events</a>. An example of gesture events is the <a href=\"http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Browser/BrowserSurface/\">\r\n\t\tBrowser Surface</a> Test Drive demo shown below.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\">\r\n\t<img style=\"max-width: 95%; box-shadow: 3px 3px 8px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25);\" alt=\"Screen shot of the Browser Surface demo showing pictures randomly arranged on the surface.\"\r\n\t\tsrc=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/0083.gr_2D00_image1.jpg\" /><br />\r\n\t<span style=\"display: inline-block; padding-top: 4px;\">Users can drag, pinch, and rotate photos using the <a href=\"http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Browser/BrowserSurface/\">Browser Surface demo</a></span></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIE10 in the Windows 8 Release Preview introduces <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh968249(v=vs.85).aspx\">gesture recognition objects</a> in JavaScript.\r\n\tSites can create gesture objects, decide which pointers (mouse, pen, or touch contacts) to process, and direct the gesture events at whatever element is desired.\r\n\tThe browser then calculates what gesture is being performed and notifies the page via events. This enables developers to build gesture experiences not yet natively\r\n\tpossible in any other browser. These include multiple concurrent gestures, for example, rotating two puzzle pieces with your hands.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLet’s take a look at how this works in code.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tCreating a Gesture Object</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe first step in handling gestures in your site is to instantiate a gesture object.</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n\t<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">var</span> myGesture = <span style=\"color: Blue;\">new</span> MSGesture();</code></p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNext, give the gesture a target element. This is the element to which the browser will fire gesture events. It’s also the element that determines the coordinate\r\n\tspace for the events.\r\n</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n\t<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>elm = document.getElementById(<span style=\"color: Maroon;\">&quot;someElement&quot;</span>);</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>myGesture.target = elm;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>elm.addEventListener(<span style=\"color: Maroon;\">&quot;MSGestureChange&quot;</span>, handleGesture);</code></p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFinally, tell the gesture object which pointers to process in its gesture recognition.\r\n</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n\t<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>elm.addEventListener(<span style=\"color: Maroon;\">&quot;MSPointerDown&quot;</span>, <span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span> (evt) {</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">// adds the current mouse, pen, or touch contact for gesture recognition</span></code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>myGesture.addPointer(evt.pointerId);</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>});</code></p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNote: don’t forget you need to use <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh772044(v=vs.85).aspx\"><code style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">–ms-touch-action</code></a>\r\n\tto <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2012/04/20/guidelines-for-building-touch-friendly-sites.aspx\">configure the element to not perform default touch</a>\r\n\tactions like panning and zooming, and instead provide pointer events for the input.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tHandling Gesture Events</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOnce a gesture object has a valid target and at least one pointer added to it, it will begin to fire gesture events. The gesture events come in 2 flavors: static\r\n\tgestures (like tap or hold) and dynamic gestures (like pinch, rotate, or swipe).</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n\tTap</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe most basic gesture recognition is a Tap. When a tap is detected, the <code>MSGestureTap</code> event is fired at the target element of the gesture object. Different\r\n\tfrom the click event, the tap gesture only fires when a user touches (or presses a mouse button, or touches a pen) down and up without moving. This is often useful\r\n\tif you want to differentiate between a user tapping on an element versus dragging the element.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n\tPress and Hold</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n\tA press and hold gesture happens when a user touches down with one finger, holds for a moment, and lifts without moving. During a press &amp; hold interaction,\r\n\tthe <code>MSGestureHold</code> event fires more than once for the various states of the gesture:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>element.addEventListener(<span style=\"color: Maroon;\">&quot;MSGestureHold&quot;</span>, handleHold);</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span> handleHold(evt) {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">if</span> (evt.detail &amp; evt.MSGESTURE_FLAG_BEGIN) {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><code><span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">// Begin signals the start of a gesture. For the Hold gesture, this means the user has been holding long enough in place that the gesture will become a complete press &amp; hold if the finger is lifted.</span></code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">if</span> (evt.detail &amp; evt.MSGESTURE_FLAG_END) {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><code><span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">// End signals the end of the gesture.</span></code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">if</span> (evt.detail &amp; evt.MSGESTURE_FLAG_CANCEL) {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><code><span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">// Cancel signals the user started the gesture but cancelled it. For hold, this occurs when the user drags away before lifting. This flag is sent together with the End flag, signaling the gesture recognition is complete.</span></code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h3>\r\n\tDynamic Gestures (pinch, rotate, swipe, and drag)</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDynamic gestures, like pinch or rotate, are reported in the form of transforms similar to CSS 2D Transforms. Three events are fired for dynamic gestures: <code>MSGestureStart</code>,\r\n\t<code>MSGestureChange</code> (fires repeatedly as the gesture continues), and <code>MSGestureEnd</code>. Each event contains <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh772076(v=vs.85).aspx\">\r\n\t\tinformation</a> about scale (pinch), rotation, translation, and velocity.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBecause dynamic gestures report transforms, it’s easy to use <code>MSGesture</code> with CSS 2D Transforms to manipulate an element like a photo or puzzle piece. For example, you\r\n\tcan enable scaling, rotating, and dragging of element as follows:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n\t<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>targetElement.addEventListener(<span style=\"color: Maroon;\">&quot;MSGestureChange&quot;</span>, manipulateElement);</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span> manipulateElement(e) {</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">// Uncomment the following code if you want to disable the built-in inertia provided by dynamic gesture recognition</span></code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">// if (e.detail == e.MSGESTURE_FLAG_INERTIA)</span></code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">// return;</span></code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 2em\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>&nbsp;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">var</span> m = <span style=\"color: Blue;\">new</span> MSCSSMatrix(e.target.style.transform); <span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">//\r\n\t\t\t\tGet the latest CSS transform on the element</span></code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>e.target.style.transform = m</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>.translate(e.offsetX, e.offsetY) <span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">// Move the transform origin under the center of the gesture</span></code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>.rotate(e.rotation * 180 / Math.PI) <span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">// Apply Rotation</span></code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>.scale(e.scale) <span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">// Apply Scale</span></code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>.translate(e.translationX, e.translationY) <span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">// Apply Translation</span></code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>.translate(-e.offsetX, -e.offsetY); <span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">// Move the transform origin back</span></code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>}</code></p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDynamic gestures like scale and rotate are supported with mouse by rotating the mouse wheel with the CTRL or SHIFT modifier keys, respectively.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tSummary</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIE10’s gesture events enable you to build touch experiences not currently possible in any other browser.

In particular, pages often clip or distort layout when viewed in a narrow width.\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\">\r\n\t<img style=\"max-width: 40%; border: 1px solid #999; box-shadow: 3px 3px 8px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25);\" alt=\"Screen shot of TechCrunch Web site displayed in a very narrow Window.

This situation also occurs for portrait mode on slate devices due to the smaller form factor.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the Metro style browser, the snapped view and portrait mode are auto-scaled by default to ensure at least 1024 pixels of layout width.

In addition to fitting the site into a narrower region, this also may require\r\n\tchanges to image sizes, reordering of content, alternative tools for site navigation, or other fundamental changes to content.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIf your site has already made these modifications for narrow windows, then Device Adaptation can be used to override the default scale.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor some great examples of adaptive layouts, check out <a href=\"http://mediaqueri.es/\">Media Queries</a>. Metal Toad Media also has a great article discussing <a\r\n\t\thref=\"http://www.metaltoad.com/blog/simple-device-diagram-responsive-design-planning\">layout width support</a> based on prevalent devices and screen sizes in\r\n\tthe market.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tUsing @-ms-viewport</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<b>Simple support for the snapped view.</b> If your site is already capable of a 320 pixel width layout, you can easily choose to show that version in the snapped view. Combining\r\n\tDevice Adaptation with CSS media queries allows the auto-scaling feature to be overridden selectively. This CSS overrides the default auto-scaling, and instead\r\n\tenforces a consistent 320 pixel layout width for all windows 320 pixels wide or narrower:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n\t<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">@media</span> screen and (max-width: 320px) {</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">@-ms-viewport</span> { <span style=\"color: Red;\">width</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">320px</span>; }</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>}</code></p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen the window is less than 320 pixels wide the content will be scaled down to fit. For example, a 300 pixel wide window will show the content at 93.75%\r\n\tscale. For larger widths, IE10’s normal scaling applies (for example, when the Metro style browser is in portrait mode).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDevice adaptation degrades gracefully in browsers which do not yet support it. These browsers can still benefit from narrow layout support—they just won’t auto-scale\r\n\tto fit content to the window.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<b>Portrait support.</b> If your site supports a 768 pixel wide layout as well, then portrait mode support can be easily added with a second viewport rule:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n\t<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">@media</span> screen and (max-width: 320px) {</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">@-ms-viewport</span> { <span style=\"color: Red;\">width</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">320px</span>; }</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>}</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 2em\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>&nbsp;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">@media</span> screen and (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 959px) {</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">@-ms-viewport</span> { <span style=\"color: Red;\">width</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">768px</span>; }</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>}</code></p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe recommend testing your site in layout widths of 768 pixels (portrait on most slates) and 320 pixels (snapped Metro style browser) in addition to 1024 pixels and wider (landscape).

25af9ead-6f89-227d-3ade-1398a50451d9.description	"<p>In an <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2012/06/13/advances-in-javascript-performance-in-ie10-and-windows-8.aspx\">earlier post</a> we discussed JavaScript performance improvements introduced in IE10. Today we published <a href=\"http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/performance/bubbles/\">Bubbles</a>, originally inspired by Alex Gavriolov&rsquo;s simulation <a href=\"http://www.bubblemark.com/\">BubbleMark</a>, to explore some of these advances. The current version has been greatly expanded to take advantage of the new features of the Web platform and includes characteristics common to HTML5 games. In this post we peek under the hood to see how the demo is constructed and examine the main factors that affect its performance.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\"><img style=\"max-width: 95%; border: 1px solid #999; box-shadow: 3px 3px 8px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25);\" alt=\"Screen shot of Bubbles demo running in Metro style IE10 on the Windows 8 Release Preview\" src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/0841.uthb_2D00_image3.jpg\" /><br /> <span style=\"display: inline-block; padding-top: 4px;\"><a href=\"http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/performance/bubbles/\">Bubbles demo</a> running in Metro style IE10 on the Windows 8 Release Preview</span></p>\r\n<h2>The Structure of the Demo</h2>\r\n<p>The demo consists of a number of animated bubbles floating through space. At the core is a relatively simple JavaScript physics engine. On every animation frame, about 60 times per second, the physics engine recalculates the positions of all bubbles, adjusts the speed of each bubble by applying gravity, and computes collisions. All these computations involve intensive floating point math. Each bubble is represented on screen by a DOM image element to which a CSS transform is applied. The image is first translated around its origin, and then scaled dynamically to produce the effect of the bubble inflating. In JavaScript, every bubble is represented as an object with accessor properties, as introduced in ECMAScript 5.</p>\r\n<p>Behind the floating bubbles is a large image, which starts off occluded by a fully opaque mask rendered in a &lt;canvas&gt; element. Whenever two bubbles collide, a portion of the occluding mask is removed by applying a Gaussian filter to the mask&rsquo;s opacity component to produce a diffuse transparency effect. This process also involves many floating point multiplications, which are performed on elements of <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/12/01/working-with-binary-data-using-typed-arrays.aspx\"> Typed Arrays</a>, if supported by the browser.</p>\r\n<p>Over the floating bubbles rests a touch surface, which responds to touch input if supported by the running browser or mouse events if not. In response to touch simulated magnetic repulsion is applied to the floating bubbles scattering them around.</p>\r\n<h2>Efficient Animation</h2>\r\n<p>In IE10 we introduced support for the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-animation-timing-20110602/\">requestAnimationFrame</a> API. When building JavaScript applications with animation we continue to recommend using this API (instead of setTimeout or setInterval) on browsers that support it. As discussed in a <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/07/05/using-pc-hardware-more-efficiently-in-html5-new-web-performance-apis-part-1.aspx\"> previous post</a> exploring how to make the most of your hardware, this API allows you to achieve maximum frame rate supported by the available display while avoiding excessive work that would remain invisible to the user. By doing the minimal number of operations to deliver the best user experience, you can save battery power. IE10 Release Preview <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2012/06/06/moving-the-stable-web-forward-in-ie10-release-preview.aspx\">supports this API</a> without vendor prefix, but the prefixed version is also maintained for compatibility with earlier IE10 preview releases. The Bubbles demo uses this API and falls back to setTimeout when it is not available.</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>Demo.prototype.requestAnimationFrame = <span style=\"color: blue;\">function</span> () {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">var</span> that = <span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">if</span> (window.requestAnimationFrame)</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.animationFrameTimer =</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 10em;\"><code>window.requestAnimationFrame(<span style=\"color: blue;\">function</span> () { that.onAnimationFrame(); });</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">else</span></code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.animationFrameTimer =</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 10em;\"><code>setTimeout(<span style=\"color: blue;\">function</span> () { that.onAnimationFrame(); }, <span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.animationFrameDuration);</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 2em;\"><code>&nbsp;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>Demo.prototype.cancelAnimationFrame = <span style=\"color: blue;\">function</span> () {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">if</span> (window.cancelAnimationFrame)</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><code>window.cancelAnimationFrame(<span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.animationFrameTimer);</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">else</span></code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><code>clearTimeout(<span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.animationFrameTimer);</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2>Converting DOM Values from Strings to Numbers</h2>\r\n<p>JavaScript is very flexible and includes a range of automatic conversions between values of different types. For example, string values are automatically converted to number values when used in arithmetic operations. In modern browsers, this convenience may come at a surprisingly high performance cost. Type specialized code emitted by state-of-the-art JavaScript compilers is very efficient in arithmetic on values of known types, but incurs very high overhead when it encounters values of unexpected types.</p>\r\n<p>When the Bubbles demo is loaded, the <code>numberOfBubbles</code> property starts off with a value of 100. On every animation frame, the position of each bubble is adjusted:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">function</span> Demo() {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.numberOfBubbles = 100;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: #006400;\">//...</span></code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 2em;\"><code>&nbsp;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>Demo.prototype.moveBubbles = <span style=\"color: blue;\">function</span>(elapsedTime) {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">for</span> (<span style=\"color: blue;\">var</span> i = 0; i &lt; <span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.numberOfBubbles; i++) {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.bubbles[i].move(elapsedTime, <span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.gravity);</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>When the user selects a different value in the UI, the value of the <code>numberOfBubbles</code> property must be adjusted accordingly. A straightforward event handler may do it like this:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>Demo.prototype.onNumberOfBubblesChange = <span style=\"color: blue;\">function</span> () {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.numberOfBubbles = document.getElementById(<span style=\"color: maroon;\">\"numberOfBubblesSelector\"</span>).value;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: #006400;\">//...</span></code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>This seemingly natural way of reading the user&rsquo;s input results in about 10% overhead in the JavaScript portion of the demo. Because the value obtained from the drop down and assigned to <code>numberOfBubbles</code> is a string (not a number), it has to be converted to a number on every iteration of the <code>moveBubbles</code> loop for every frame of the animation.</p>\r\n<p>This demonstrates that it&rsquo;s a good practice to explicitly convert values extracted from the DOM to numbers <i>before</i> using them in arithmetic operations. Values of DOM properties are typically of type string in JavaScript and the automatic string to number conversions can be quite expensive when done repeatedly. A better way to update <code>numberOfBubbles</code> based on user selection, as found in the demo, is as follows:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>Demo.prototype.onNumberOfBubblesChange = <span style=\"color: blue;\">function</span> () {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.numberOfBubbles = parseInt(document.getElementById(<span style=\"color: maroon;\">\"numberOfBubblesSelector\"</span>).value);</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: #006400;\">//...</span></code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2>Working with ES5 Accessor Properties</h2>\r\n<p>ECMAScript 5 accessor properties are a convenient mechanism for data encapsulation, computed properties, data validation, or change notification.

When working with floating point numbers it is advantageous to use Typed Arrays (Float32Array or Float64Array) instead of JavaScript arrays (Array). JavaScript arrays can hold elements of any type, but typically require that floating point values be allocated on the heap (boxing) before being added to the array. This affects performance. To achieve consistently high performance on modern browsers use Float32Array or Float64Array to indicate the intent of storing floating point values. Doing so you help the JavaScript engine avoid heap boxing and turn on other compiler optimizations, like generating type specialized operations.</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>BubbleTank.prototype.generateOcclusionMask = <span style=\"color: blue;\">function</span>() {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">if</span> (<span style=\"color: blue;\">typeof</span> Float64Array != <span style=\"color: maroon;\">\"undefined\"</span>) {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.occlusionMask = <span style=\"color: blue;\">new</span> Float64Array(<span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.canvasWidth * <span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.canvasHeight);</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code>} <span style=\"color: blue;\">else</span> {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.occlusionMask = <span style=\"color: blue;\">new</span> Array(<span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.canvasWidth * <span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.canvasHeight);</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.resetOcclusionMask();</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>The example above shows how the Bubbles demo uses Float64Arrays to hold and update the occlusion mask applied to the canvas hiding the background image. If the browser doesn&rsquo;t support Typed Arrays, the code falls back on regular arrays. The gains from using Type Arrays in the Bubbles demo vary with settings. In a medium-sized window in IE10, Typed Arrays improve the overall frame rate by around 10%.</p>\r\n<h2>Summary</h2>\r\n<p>In this blog post we explored the newly published Bubbles demo and examined how it takes advantage of dramatic gains in JavaScript execution the IE10 Release Preview. We shared a few important techniques to achieve good performance in animation-based applications.

Windows 8 includes one HTML5 browsing engine that powers both browsing experiences (Metro style and desktop) as well as Metro\r\n\tstyle applications that use HTML5 and JavaScript. The release preview represents a major revision of the same modern JavaScript engine, Chakra, which first debuted\r\n\twith IE9. With each platform preview we make progress against our goals to create an engine that delivers great performance on the Web while ensuring that it is\r\n\thighly compatible, interoperable, and secure. This post will explore how the JavaScript engine has been enhanced to deliver great performance for emerging Web application\r\n\tscenarios.\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tPerformance for Real Web Applications</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWeb applications have been evolving rapidly in recent years. A decade ago the Web consisted primarily of Web sites with static content, like what you may encounter\r\n\tin a <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/\">blog</a>, a <a href=\"http://www.alwaysfreshgoodness.com/\">small</a> <a href=\"http://totokaelo.com/\">business</a> landing\r\n\tpage, or on <a href=\"http://www.wikipedia.org/\">Wikipedia</a>. The emergence of AJAX helped spawn more complex and interactive sites like what you see on <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com\">\r\n\t\tFacebook</a> or <a href=\"http://www.jetsetter.com/\">JetSetter</a>. Subsequent advances in performance allowed for large and complex applications to be created,\r\n\tsuch as <a href=\"http://1263974.r.msn.com/?ld=4vIua1S_hstxxIgu4bLH1zvR9AcSvkbb4f6awqeSajhpqnmwjBxg0ImvUDzhsPXYhsJh3LVIAsK-d88KVSxUu1Yv6DfWsQZPwKVZOu7teP0Z9SqYgFtcEdwXF7qtIbOxJ0qVAyJYIs_pYT7P7uMRjtp_ndnaUagsGPEH8vjEbYMwLkxOdV6D0ZoCF9ebr2rY7vq0KoXtN-UXu-306O2bzOCQ_bwRfG0CQe_2CAOx9a4QKogNmGQeKsUkfNw_l-GQ9s3xas5_c4bGTP62QRJgxOaf0bQQFmOrKkAr7K7zYPc66Q0TB7OApP1bh9T9s9LCpn37sJK4lSaA0GmgwYsk6qADqEl7CH2ArfnMsW1vEmAYg2O5lQQowjlUGMkCYBZkMVnlmQ59MLKAv9p4CemuE-ieoBtiMVmwZE4IgGVJAaawxjpspaj0xFuctgnuofHt69iZrWVmrUudjR5EDYMCPRSE9HTATFxpqP4qXI9AemDxqDxEJOVmMV4fKcb_vX-04UKKBcPBAmY3M95k4NcR4qGYx6yaSeuFaJVf4rEqYNjFjZtor7mTcP27U\">\r\n\t\tOffice 365</a>, <a href=\"http://maps.bing.com/\">Bing Maps</a>, etc. Most recently, the expansion of the W3C standard APIs, gains in JavaScript performance,\r\n\tand hardware accelerated graphics made building even sophisticated games on the Web possible, for example, <a href=\"http://chrome.angrybirds.com/\">Angry Birds</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pirateslovedaisies.com/\">Pirates Love Daisies</a>,\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.cuttherope.ie/\">Cut The Rope</a>, etc.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\">\r\n\t<img style=\"max-width: 95%;\" alt=\"Diagram showing spectrum of Web pages and their performance characteristics. On the left are Basic Web Pages where Page Load Time is the driving performance goal. On the right are Web Applications, HTML5 Games, and Windows 8 Metro style apps where JavaScript Execution Speed, DOM Interactions, and Accelerated graphics have the biggest impact on performance.\"\r\n\t\tsrc=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/3286.aijpiiaw_2D00_image3_5F00_760x299.PNG\" /></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAs applications evolve, the performance factors affecting user experience change. For traditional Web sites, initial page load determines how quickly the user can\r\n\tsee the content. Interactive Web sites and large Web applications may be gated by the efficiency of DOM operations, CSS processing, and manipulation of large internal\r\n\tstate in memory. HTML5 games often depend on fast canvas rendering, JavaScript execution and efficient garbage collection. In short, browser performance is a complex\r\n\tproblem, which requires taking into account the needs of a broad spectrum of diverse applications.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn this post we fill focus on performance of only one browser subsystem, the JavaScript engine. With recent gains in JavaScript performance, for many Web applications\r\n\tJavaScript execution is no longer a limiting factor. On the other hand, as performance increases, new scenarios emerge that place additional demands on the JavaScript\r\n\tengine. We continually look for opportunities to evolve Chakra to match performance requirements of real JavaScript-intensive applications.\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\">\r\n\t<img style=\"max-width: 95%; padding-bottom: 8px;\" alt=\"Two dimension chart showing screen shots of various sites plotted on two axis: Use of Other Browser Components (Y) and JavaScript Execution (X).

This involves deferring as much work as possible until absolutely necessary, avoiding\r\n\t\twork altogether, making use of periods of inactivity, and parallelizing work to minimize impact on the responsiveness of the application.<br />\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Take advantage of all available hardware. This translates to utilizing all available CPU cores, as well as generating advanced specialized CPU instructions, for example, \r\n\t\tIntel’s SSE2, if available.<br />\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\">\r\n\t<img style=\"max-width: 95%;\" alt=\"Diagram illustrating the Chakra JavaScript engine&#39;s use of two processor cores.\" src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/6232.aijpiiaw_2D00_image5_5F00_760x317.PNG\" /><br />\r\n\tChakra’s Parallel Architecture</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tChakra, though only one of the browser subsystems – is itself comprised of several components which work together to process and execute JavaScript code. When the\r\n\tbrowser downloads a JavaScript file it hands its content over to Chakra’s parser to verify its syntactical correctness. This is the only operation that applies\r\n\tto the entire file. Subsequent steps are performed individually on each function (including the global function). As a function is about to be executed (the global\r\n\tfunction is run immediately after parsing) Chakra’s parser builds an abstract syntax tree (AST) representation of the code, and hands it off to the bytecode generator,\r\n\twhich produces an intermediate form (bytecode) suitable for execution by the interpreter (but not directly by the CPU). Both the AST and the function bytecode are\r\n\tpreserved so they don’t need to be recreated on subsequent executions. The interpreter is then invoked to run the function. As the interpreter executes individual\r\n\toperations it collects information (a profile) about the types of inputs it encounters and keeps track of how many times the function was called.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAs the number of calls reaches certain threshold, the interpreter queues the function up for compilation. Unlike in other browsers, Chakra’s just-in-time (JIT)\r\n\tcompiler runs on a separate dedicated thread and thus does not interfere with script execution. The sole job of the compiler is to generate optimized machine instructions\r\n\tfor each function in the compilation queue. Once a function is compiled, the availability of the machine code is signaled to the main script thread. Upon the next\r\n\tinvocation, the entry point to the function is redirected to the newly compiled machine code and execution proceeds directly on the CPU. It’s important to note that\r\n\tfunctions that are called only once or twice never actually get compiled, which saves time and resources.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJavaScript is a managed runtime in that memory management is hidden from the developer and performed by an automatic garbage collector, which runs periodically\r\n\tto clean up any objects that are no longer in use. Chakra employs a conservative, quasi-generational, mark and sweep, garbage collector that does most of its work\r\n\tconcurrently on a dedicated thread to minimize script execution pauses that would interrupt the user experience.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis architecture allows Chakra to start executing JavaScript code almost immediately during page load. On the other hand, during periods of intense JavaScript\r\n\tactivity, Chakra can parallelize work and saturate up to three CPU cores by running script, compiling and collecting garbage at the same time.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tFast Page Load Time</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEven relatively static Web sites tend to use JavaScript for interactivity, advertising, or social sharing. In fact, the volume of JavaScript included in <a href=\"http://www.alexa.com/topsites\">\r\n\t\tAlexa’s top 1 million pages</a> has been steadily increasing, as reported by <a href=\"http://httparchive.org/index.php\">Steve Souders’ HTTP Archive</a>.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\">\r\n\t<img style=\"max-width: 95%; padding-bottom: 8px;\" alt=\"Chart showing volume of JavaScript in Alexa’s Top 1 Million Pages\" src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/5153.aijpiiaw_2D00_image6_5F00_598x295.png\" /><br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://httparchive.org/trends.php?s=All&amp;minlabel=Dec+28+2010&amp;maxlabel=May+15+2012#bytesJS&amp;reqJS\">Volume of JavaScript in Alexa’s Top 1 Million\r\n\t\tPages</a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe JavaScript code included in these Web sites must be processed by the browser’s JavaScript engine and the global function of each script file must be executed\r\n\tbefore the content can be fully rendered. Consequently, it is crucial that the amount of work performed on this critical path be minimized. Chakra’s parser and\r\n\tbytecode interpreter were designed with this objective in mind.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\r\n\t<b>Bytecode Interpreter.</b> JavaScript code executed during page load often performs initialization and setup that is executed only once. To minimize the overall\r\n\tpage load time it is imperative to start executing this code immediately – without waiting for a just-in-time compiler to process the code and emit machine instructions.\r\n\tThe interpreter starts running JavaScript code as soon as it is translated into bytecode. To further reduce the time to first executed instruction, Chakra processes\r\n\tand emits bytecode only for functions that are about to be executed using a mechanism called deferred parsing.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<b>Deferred Parsing.</b> <img style=\"padding: 8px 0 8px 12px; float: right;\" alt=\"Chart showing the fraction of code executed in 11 popular Web sites. The amount ranges from a little over 30% to a little over 50%.\"\r\n\t\tsrc=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/7416.aijpiiaw_2D00_image7_5F00_300x249.png\" />The <a href=\"http://www.research.microsoft.com/JSMeter\">JSMeter</a> project from Microsoft Research showed that typical Web pages use only a fraction\r\n\tof code that they download – generally on the order of 40-50% (see chart to right). Intuitively, this makes sense: developers often include popular JavaScript libraries like <a href=\"http://jquery.com/\">\r\n\t\tjQuery</a> or <a href=\"http://dojotoolkit.org/\">dojo</a> or custom ones like those used in Office 365, but only leverage a fraction of the functionality the\r\n\tlibrary supports.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo optimize such scenarios, Chakra performs only the most basic syntax-only parsing of the source code. The rest of the work (building the abstract syntax tree\r\n\tand generating bytecode) is performed one function at a time only when the function is about to be invoked. This strategy not only helps with the responsiveness\r\n\tof the browser when loading Web pages, but also reduces the memory footprint.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn IE9 there was one limitation of Chakra’s deferred parsing. Functions nested inside other functions had to be parsed immediately with their enclosing functions.\r\n\tThis restriction proved important because many JavaScript libraries employ the so called “<a href=\"http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/04/22/the-module-pattern-in-a-nutshell/\">module\r\n\t\tpattern</a>,” in which most of the library’s code is enclosed in a large function which is immediately executed. In IE10 we removed this restriction and Chakra\r\n\tnow defers parsing and bytecode generation of any function that is not immediately executed.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"clear:both;\">\r\n\tPerformance Improvements for JavaScript-Intensive Applications</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn IE10, as in IE9 before, we strive to improve the performance of real Web applications. However, Web applications depend on JavaScript performance to a varying\r\n\tdegree. To discuss the enhancements in IE10 it’s most useful to focus on those applications which are JavaScript-intensive; where improvements in Chakra yield substantial\r\n\tperformance gains. An important class of JavaScript-intensive applications includes HTML5 games and simulations.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAt the onset of IE10 we analyzed a sample of popular JavaScript games (for example, <a href=\"http://chrome.angrybirds.com/\">Angry Birds</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cuttherope.ie/\">\r\n\t\tCut the Rope</a>, or <a href=\"http://playtankworld.com/\">Tankworld</a>) and simulations (for example, <a href=\"http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Performance/FishIETank/Default.html\">\r\n\t\t\tFishIE Tank</a>, <a href=\"http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Performance/FishBowl/\">HTML5 Fish Bowl</a>, <a href=\"http://mrdoob.com/projects/chromeexperiments/ball_pool/\">\r\n\t\t\t\tBall Pool</a>, <a href=\"http://jarrodoverson.com/static/demos/particleSystem/\">Particle System</a>) to understand what performance improvements would\r\n\thave the most significant impact on the user experience. Our analysis revealed a number of common characteristics and coding patterns. All of the applications are driven\r\n\tby a high frequency timer callback. Most of them use canvas for rendering, but some rely on animating DOM elements, and some use a combination of the two. In most\r\n\tapplications at least portions of the code are written in the object oriented style – either in application code or in included libraries (for example, <a href=\"http://box2d-js.sourceforge.net/\">\r\n\t\tBox2d.js</a>). Short functions are common, as are frequent property reads and writes, and polymorphism. All of the applications perform floating point arithmetic\r\n\tand many allocate a fair amount of memory putting pressure on the garbage collector. These common patterns became the focus of our performance work in IE10. The\r\n\tfollowing sections describe the changes we’ve made in response.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tJust-in-Time Compiler – Reconsidered and Improved</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIE10 includes substantial improvements to Chakra’s JIT compiler. We added support for two additional processor architectures: x64 and ARM. That’s why, whether your\r\n\tJavaScript application is experienced by the user on a 64-bit PC or an ARM-based tablet, it enjoys the benefits of executing directly on the CPU.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe also changed the fundamental approach to generating machine code. JavaScript is a very dynamic language, which limits how much a compiler can know when generating\r\n\tcode. For example, when compiling the function below, the compiler doesn’t know the shape (property layout) of the objects involved or types of their properties.</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span> compute(v, w) {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">return</span> v.x + w.y;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn IE9 Chakra’s compiler generated code that located every property at runtime and handled all plausible operations (in the example above: integer addition, floating\r\n\tpoint addition, or even string concatenation). Some of these operations were handled directly in machine code, while others required help from Chakra’s runtime.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn IE10, the JIT compiler generates profile-based, type-specialized machine code. In other words, it generates machine code that is tailored to objects of a particular\r\n\tshape and values of a particular type. To emit the right code the compiler needs to know what types of input values to expect. Because JavaScript is a dynamic language,\r\n\tthis information is not available in the source code. We enhanced Chakra’s interpreter to collect it at runtime, a technique we call dynamic profiling. When a function\r\n\tis scheduled for JIT compilation, the compiler examines the runtime profile gathered by the interpreter and emits code tailored to the expected inputs.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The interpreter gathers information for the runs it observes, but it’s possible that the execution of the program will lead to runtime values which violate assumptions \r\n\tmade in the generated optimized code. For every assumption it makes, the compiler emits a runtime check.  If a later execution results in an unexpected value, the check \r\n\tfails, execution bails out of the specialized machine code, and is continued in the interpreter. The reason for bailout (the failed check) is recorded, additional profile \r\n\tinformation is collected by the interpreter, and the function is recompiled with different assumptions.  Bailout and re-compilation are two fundamentally new capabilities\r\n\tin IE10.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe net effect is that Chakra’s IE10 compiler generates fewer machine instructions for your code, reducing the overall memory footprint and speeding up execution.\r\n\tThis particularly impacts apps with floating point arithmetic and object property access, like the HTML5 games and simulations we previously discussed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIf you write JavaScript code in the object oriented style, your code will also benefit from Chakra’s support for function inlining. Object oriented code commonly\r\n\tcontains a large proportion of relatively small methods, for which the overhead of the function call is significant compared to the execution time of the function.\r\n\tFunction inlining allows Chakra to reduce this overhead, but more importantly it greatly expands the scope of other traditional compiler optimizations, such as\r\n\tloop invariant code motion or copy propagation.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tFaster Floating Point Arithmetic</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMost JavaScript programs perform some amount of integer arithmetic. As the example below illustrates, even in programs that don’t focus primarily on arithmetic,\r\n\tinteger values are commonly used as iteration variables in loops or as indices into arrays.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span> findString(s, a) {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">for</span> (<span style=\"color: Blue;\">var</span> i = 0, al = a.length; i &lt; al; i++) {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">if</span> (a[i] == s) <span style=\"color: Blue;\">return</span> i;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">return</span> -1;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFloating point math, on the other hand, is typically restricted to certain classes of applications such as games, simulations, sound, image or video processing,\r\n\tetc. Historically, few such applications were written in JavaScript, but recent advances in browser performance have made JavaScript implementations viable. In\r\n\tIE9 we optimized Chakra for the more common integer operations. In IE10 we dramatically improved floating point math.</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span> compute(a, b, c, d) {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">return</span> (a + b) * (c &#8722; d);</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGiven a simple function above a JavaScript compiler cannot determine the types of arguments a, b, c and d from the source code. The IE9 compiler would assume that\r\n\tthe arguments were likely to be integer numbers and generate fast integer machine instructions. This worked very well if during execution the arguments were, indeed,\r\n\tintegers. If floating point numbers were used instead, the code had to rely on much slower helper functions in Chakra’s runtime. The overhead of function calls\r\n\twas further exacerbated by boxing and unboxing of intermediate values on the heap (in most 32-bit JavaScript engines, including Chakra, individual floating point\r\n\tvalues must be allocated on the heap). In the expression above the result of each operation required a heap allocation, followed by storing the value on the heap,\r\n\tand then retrieval of the value from the heap for the next operation.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn IE10, the compiler takes advantage of the profile information collected by the interpreter to generate dramatically faster floating point code. In the example\r\n\tabove, if the profile indicates that all arguments are likely to be floating point numbers, the compiler will emit floating point machine instructions. The entire\r\n\texpression will be computed in just three machine instructions (assuming all arguments are already in registers), all intermediate values will be stored in registers,\r\n\tand only one heap allocation will be required to return the final result.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor floating point intensive applications this is a massive performance gain. Experiments show that in IE10 floating point operations execute about 50% faster than\r\n\tin IE9. In addition, the reduced rate of memory allocation means fewer garbage collections.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tFaster Objects and Property Access</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJavaScript objects are a convenient and broadly used mechanism for grouping logically related sets of values. Whether you’re using JavaScript objects in a structured\r\n\tobject oriented programming style or merely as flexible packaging for values, your code will greatly benefit from the improvements in object allocation and property\r\n\taccess performance added in IE10.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAs mentioned earlier, efficient property access is complicated in JavaScript because the shape of an object isn’t known during compilation. JavaScript objects can\r\n\tbe created ad hoc without a predefined type or class. New properties can be added to (or even removed from) objects on the fly and in any order. As a result, when\r\n\tcompiling the following method, the compiler doesn’t know where to find the values of properties x, y, and z on the Vector object.\r\n</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>Vector.prototype.magnitude = <span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span>() {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">return</span> Math.sqrt(<span style=\"color: Blue;\">this</span>.x * <span style=\"color: Blue;\">this</span>.x + <span style=\"color: Blue;\">this</span>.y * <span style=\"color: Blue;\">this</span>.y + <span style=\"color: Blue;\">this</span>.z * <span style=\"color: Blue;\">this</span>.z);</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn IE9 we introduced inline caches which greatly speed up access to properties. Inline caches remember the shape of the object and the location in the object’s\r\n\tmemory where a given property can be found. Inline caches can remember only one object shape and work well if all objects a function works with are of the same\r\n\tshape. In IE10 we added a secondary caching mechanism which improves performance of code operating on objects of different shapes (polymorphic).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBefore a property value can be read the compiler must verify that the object’s shape matches that stored in the inline cache. To do that, in IE9, the compiler\r\n\tgenerates a runtime shape check before every property access. Because programs often read or write multiple properties of the same object in close succession (as\r\n\tin the example below), all these checks add overhead.</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span> collide(b1, b2) {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">var</span> dx = b1.x - b2.x;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">var</span> dy = b1.y - b2.y;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">var</span> dvx = b1.vx - b2.vx;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">var</span> dvy = b1.vy - b2.vy;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">var</span> distanceSquare = (dx * dx + dy * dy) || 1.0;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">//...</span></code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn IE10, Chakra generates code tailored to the expected object shape. Through careful symbol tracking combined with bailout and re-compilation capabilities the\r\n\tnew compiler dramatically reduces the number of runtime shape checks performed. In the example above, instead of 8 separate shape checks, only 2 are done, one each\r\n\tfor b1 and b2. In addition, once the shape of an object has been established, all property locations are known, and read or write operations are as efficient as\r\n\tin C++.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn ECMAScript 5 objects may contain a new kind of properties, called accessor properties. Accessor properties differ from traditional data properties in that custom\r\n\tget and set functions are invoked to handle the read and write operations. Accessor properties are a convenient mechanism for adding data encapsulation, computed\r\n\tproperties, data validation, or change notification. Chakra’s internal type system and inline caches were designed to accommodate accessor properties and facilitate\r\n\tefficient reading and writing of their values.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIf you write an HTML5 game or animation, you often need a physics engine which performs computation required to produce realistic movement of objects under the\r\n\tforce of gravity, simulate collisions, etc. For very simple physics, you may build your own engine, but for a more complex requirements, you would typically use\r\n\tone of the popular physics libraries now available in JavaScript, such as <a href=\"http://box2d-js.sourceforge.net/\">Box2d.js</a> (ported from <a href=\"http://box2d.org/\">\r\n\t\tBox2d</a>). These libraries often use small objects, such as Point, Vector or Color. On every animation frame a large number of these objects are created and\r\n\tpromptly discarded. Therefore, it’s important that the JavaScript runtime create objects efficiently.\r\n</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">var</span> Vector = <span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span>(x, y, z) {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">this</span>.x = x;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">this</span>.y = y;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">this</span>.z = z;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 2em\"><code>&nbsp;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>Vector.prototype = {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">//...</span></code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code>normalize : <span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span>() {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">var</span> m = Math.sqrt((<span style=\"color: Blue;\">this</span>.x * <span style=\"color: Blue;\">this</span>.x) + (<span style=\"color: Blue;\">this</span>.y * <span style=\"color: Blue;\">this</span>.y) + (<span style=\"color: Blue;\">this</span>.z * <span style=\"color: Blue;\">this</span>.z));</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">return</span> <span style=\"color: Blue;\">new</span> Vector(<span style=\"color: Blue;\">this</span>.x / m, <span style=\"color: Blue;\">this</span>.y / m, <span style=\"color: Blue;\">this</span>.z / m);</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code>},</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 2em\"><code>&nbsp;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code>add : <span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span>(v, w) {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">return</span> <span style=\"color: Blue;\">new</span> Vector(w.x + v.x, w.y + v.y, w.z + v.z);</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code>},</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 2em\"><code>&nbsp;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code>cross : <span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span>(v, w) {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">return</span> <span style=\"color: Blue;\">new</span> Vector(-v.z * w.y + v.y * w.z, v.z * w.x - v.x * w.z, -v.y * w.x + v.x * w.y);</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code>},</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">//...</span></code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn IE10, the internal layout of JavaScript objects is optimized to streamline object creation. In IE9 every object consisted of a fixed-size header and an expandable\r\n\tproperty array. The latter is necessary to accommodate additional properties that may be added after the object has been created. Not all JavaScript applications\r\n\texploit this flexibility, and objects often receive most of their properties at construction. This trait allows Chakra to allocate most of the properties for such\r\n\tobjects directly with the header, which results in only one memory allocation (instead of two) for every newly created object. This change also reduces the number\r\n\tof memory dereferences required to read or write the object’s property, and improves register utilization. Improved object layout and fewer runtime shape checks\r\n\tresult in up to 50% faster property access.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tGarbage Collection Enhancements</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAs discussed above, HTML5 games and animations often create and discard objects at a very high rate. JavaScript programs don’t explicitly destroy discarded objects\r\n\tand reclaim memory. Instead, they rely on the engine’s garbage collector to periodically reclaim memory occupied by unused objects to make room for new ones. Automatic\r\n\tgarbage collection makes programming easier, but typically requires JavaScript execution to pause every now and then for the collector to do its work. If the collector\r\n\ttakes a long time to run, the whole browser may become unresponsive. In HTML5 games, even short pauses (tens of milliseconds) are disruptive because they are perceptible\r\n\tby the user as glitches in animation.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn IE10 we made a number of enhancements to our memory allocator and garbage collector. We already discussed object layout changes and generation of machine code\r\n\tspecialized for floating point arithmetic, which result in fewer memory allocations. In addition, Chakra now allocates leaf objects (for example, numbers and strings) from\r\n\ta separate memory space. Leaf objects don’t hold pointers to other objects, so they don’t require as much attention during garbage collection as regular objects.\r\n\tAllocating leaf objects from a separate space has two advantages. First, this entire space can be skipped during the mark phase, which reduces its duration. Second,\r\n\tduring concurrent collection, new allocations from the leaf object space don’t require rescanning affected pages. Because Chakra’s collector works concurrently\r\n\twith the main script thread, the running script may modify or create new objects on pages that have already been processed. To make sure such objects aren’t prematurely\r\n\tcollected, Chakra write-protects pages before the mark phase starts. Pages that have been written to during the mark phase must be later rescanned on the main script\r\n\tthread. Because leaf objects don’t require such processing, pages from the leaf object space don’t need to be write-protected or rescanned later. This saves precious\r\n\ttime on the main script thread, reducing pauses. HTML5 games and animations benefit significantly from this change, because they often work heavily with floating point\r\n\tnumbers and devote much of the allocated memory to heap-boxed numbers.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen the user interacts directly with a Web application, it is critical that the application’s code be executed as fast as possible, ideally without interruptions\r\n\tfor garbage collection. However, when the user switches away from the browser, or even just changes tabs, it is important to reduce the memory footprint of the\r\n\tnow inactive site or application. That’s why in IE9 Chakra triggered collection upon exiting JavaScript code if enough memory has been allocated. This worked well\r\n\tfor most applications, but proved problematic for applications driven by high frequency timers, such as HTML5 games and animations. For such applications collections\r\n\twere triggered too frequently and resulted in dropped frames and overall degradation of the user experience. Perhaps the most apparent manifestation of this problem\r\n\twas the <a href=\"http://www.playtankworld.com/\">Tankworld</a> game, but other HTML5 simulations also exhibited pauses in animation induced by frequent garbage collections.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn IE10 we solved this problem by coordinating garbage collections with the rest of the browser. Chakra now delays the garbage collection at the end of script execution\r\n\tand requests a callback from the browser after an interval of script inactivity. If the interval elapses before any script executes, Chakra starts a collection,\r\n\totherwise collection is further postponed. This technique permits us to shrink memory footprint when the browser (or one of its tabs) becomes inactive, while at\r\n\tthe same time greatly reducing frequency of collections in animation-driven applications.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCombined, these changes reduced the time spent in garbage collection on the main thread by an average factor of four on the HTML5 simulations measured. As a proportion\r\n\tof JavaScript execution time, garbage collection dropped from around 27% to about 6%.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tSummary\r\n</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIE10 achieves dramatic performance gains for JavaScript-intensive applications, particularly HTML5 games and simulations. These gains were accomplished through\r\n\ta range of important improvements in Chakra: from new fundamental capabilities of the JIT compiler to changes in the garbage collector.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAs we wrap up development on IE10 we celebrate the progress we’ve made, but we are keenly aware that performance is a perpetual quest. New applications emerge almost\r\n\tdaily that test the limits of modern browsers and their JavaScript engines. Without a doubt there will be plenty to work on in the next release!</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIf you’re a JavaScript developer, we’d love to hear from you.

Many of you shared feedback that you&rsquo;d like to provide higher-resolution visuals to better depict your site brand on your users&rsquo; pinned site tiles. In <a href=\"http://preview.windows.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Windows 8 Release Preview</a>, you can to do that: we&rsquo;ve added the ability for you to provide a PNG tile image and specify the tile&rsquo;s background color.</p>\r\n<h3>Example</h3>\r\n<p>Below are examples of a pinned site tile using the site&rsquo;s favicon and automatically determined color (left) and high-resolution PNG with custom tile color (right):</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\"><img alt=\"Default tile for the Fresh Tweets demo\" src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/7317.FreshTweetsDefault.png\" /><img style=\"margin-left: 2em;\" alt=\"Tile for Fresh Tweets demo following @BenThePCGuy\" src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/0385.BenThePCGuy.png\" /></p>\r\n<h3>Markup</h3>\r\n<p><code>Meta</code> tags specify the tile&rsquo;s image and background color. Example:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">&lt;</span><span style=\"color: maroon;\">meta</span> <span style=\"color: red;\">name</span><span style=\"color: blue;\">=\"msapplication-TileImage\"</span> <span style=\"color: red;\">content</span><span style=\"color: blue;\">=\"images/benthepcguy-144.png\"/&gt;</span></code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">&lt;</span><span style=\"color: maroon;\">meta</span> <span style=\"color: red;\">name</span><span style=\"color: blue;\">=\"msapplication-TileColor\"</span> <span style=\"color: red;\">content</span><span style=\"color: blue;\">=\"#d83434\"/&gt;</span></code></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Tile images must be square PNGs 144px by 144px. For best results, we recommend using a transparent background, not a background that matches the tile&rsquo;s color. The tile color can be specified as a hex RGB color using CSS&rsquo;s <code>#rrggbb</code> notation, via CSS color names, or by the CSS <code>rgb()</code> function.</p>\r\n<p>See this behavior in action on our updated <a href=\"http://ietestdrive2.com/pinnedsites/\" target=\"_blank\">Fresh Tweets demo</a>.</p>\r\n<p><b>Note:</b> IE10 only downloads the tile image when the user pins the site to his or her Start screen so sites don&rsquo;t incur additional bandwidth costs.</p>\r\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\r\n<p>Internet Explorer 10 enables Web developers to create high-quality site-centric visuals for pinned site tiles, allowing sites&rsquo; brands to be better reflected on the Windows 8 Start screen and look more visually integrated with the rest of the app and content tiles. Developers need provide only one high-quality icon that Windows 8 will scale as needed for devices running at different resolutions.</p>\r\n<p>Sites can also share notifications and offer jump lists for quickly navigating around the site. See <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2012/04/03/pinned-sites-in-windows-8.aspx\">Pinned Sites in Windows 8</a> for how.</p>\r\n<p>We look forward to you adding these simple features to your Web site to maximize their impact in Windows 8.</p>\r\n<p>&mdash;Rahul Lalmalani, Program Manager, Internet Explorer</p><div style=\"clear:both;\"></div><img src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=10317370\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">"

96f39532-c8aa-9e31-b0c1-1a66b7a686a8.description	"<p style=\"margin-bottom:0;\">As part of Windows 8 Release Preview planning, we reviewed <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh673549(v=vs.85).aspx\">all the W3C draft standards</a> supported by IE10. In particular, we looked for those specifications that:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"margin-top:0;\">\r\n<li>Are stable, that is, there were no recent additions or changes and no renaming or major changes are expected;</li>\r\n<li>Are supported by at least two browsers other than IE10;</li>\r\n<li>Are interoperable across all these browsers for the features’ core use cases;</li>\r\n<li>Are already used on the Web, including in their unprefixed form; and</li>\r\n<li>Reached Candidate Recommendation since Windows 8 Consumer Preview or are likely to become Candidate Recommendations in 2012.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:0;\">The following W3C draft standard features match these criteria and <b><i>IE10 now supports them in their unprefixed form</i></b>:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"margin-top:0;\">\r\n<li>Gradients (<a href=\"http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-images/#gradients\">CSS Image Values and Replaced Content</a>)</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-animations/\">CSS Animations</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-transitions/\">CSS Transitions</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-transforms/\">CSS Transforms</a></li>\r\n<li><code>font-feature-settings</code> property (<a href=\"http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-fonts/\">CSS Fonts</a>)</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/\">Indexed Database API</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/animation-timing/\">Timing control for script-based animations</a> (requestAnimationFrame)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>For compatibility with sites and apps developed using the Windows 8 Consumer Preview, IE10 <i>also</i> supports these standards in their vendor-prefixed form using the Microsoft vendor prefixes (<code>&#8209;ms&#8209;/ms</code>).</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:0;\">IE10 also supports the following W3C draft standards in vendor-prefixed form. We believe these drafts do not yet meet the criteria listed above:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"margin-top:0;\">\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-flexbox/\">CSS Flexible Box Layout</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-grid-layout/\">CSS Grid Layout</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-regions/\">CSS Regions</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-exclusions/\">CSS Exclusions and Shapes</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css-device-adapt/\">CSS Device Adaptation</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>From Experimental to Stable</h2>\r\n<p>When Web browsers implement emerging standards they do so by marking the new features with their own vendor prefix: a style property prefixed with <code>&#8209;moz&#8209;</code> indicates an experimental CSS feature in Mozilla's Firefox, <code>&#8209;ms&#8209;</code> means the same for Microsoft’s Internet Explorer, <code>&#8209;o&#8209;</code> for Opera, and <code>&#8209;webkit&#8209;</code> for WebKit-based browsers including Google’s Chrome and Apple’s Safari. The features’ object model equivalents are similarly prefixed.</p>\r\n<p>New platform APIs such as <code style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">window.requestAnimationFrame()</code> are likewise currently invoked as <code style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">window.mozRequestAnimationFrame()</code>, <code style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">window.webkitRequestAnimationFrame()</code>, or <code style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">window.msRequestAnimationFrame()</code>.</p>\r\n<p>Browser vendors generally drop their prefix once the corresponding specification reaches the Candidate Recommendation stage. This naming convention has a number of objectives, among which:  </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><b>Allow the specification to evolve:</b> without prefixes web content written for the earliest implementation(s) could constrain the editor(s) and make useful additions or changes difficult or even impossible, and</li>\r\n<li><b>Segregate experimental implementations:</b> the bugs or choice of draft version of a particular browser have no impact on other browsers. </li>\r\n<li><b>Style sheet documentation:</b> the vendor-specific dependencies of a style sheet are explicitly documented</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Other standards may not rely on vendor prefixes at all. For instance, browser vendors never prefixed the new HTML elements introduced by the HTML5 specification such as &lt;canvas&gt; and &lt;video&gt;. </p>\r\n<h2>The Web’s Best Practices </h2>\r\n<p>In practice, there comes a time when several browsers support the same draft feature in an interoperable manner. As a result, Web developers find themselves writing declarations such as:</p>\r\n<code style=\"display: block; font-family: Consolas, Monospace; font-size: 13px; color: Black; text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\"><div style=\"background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Red;\">-webkit-transform</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">rotate(30deg)</span>;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Red;\">-moz-transform</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">rotate(30deg)</span>;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Red;\">-ms-transform</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">rotate(30deg)</span>;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Red;\">-o-transform</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">rotate(30deg)</span>;</p>\r\n</div></code>\r\n<p>After copy and pasting this pattern a number of times, many developers assume the forthcoming W3C standard will be backward compatible with today’s Web. They proceed to “future-proof” their style sheets by adding an unprefixed version of the property:</p>\r\n<code style=\"display: block; font-family: Consolas, Monospace; font-size: 13px; color: Black; text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\"><div style=\"background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Red;\">-webkit-transform</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">rotate(30deg)</span>;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Red;\">-moz-transform</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">rotate(30deg)</span>;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Red;\">-ms-transform</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">rotate(30deg)</span>;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Red;\">-o-transform</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">rotate(30deg)</span>;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Red;\">transform</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">rotate(30deg)</span>;</p>\r\n</div></code>\r\n<p>From a web developer’s point of view, the above set of declarations is now ready for future browsers that support unprefixed CSS Transforms.</p>\r\n<p>Past standard features have in fact validated this pragmatic assumption. When IE9 added support for the unprefixed <code>border-radius</code> property in its first Platform Preview, our team saw the feature “light up” across many sites due to the future-proofed style sheets already deployed.</p>\r\n<p>A number of features are going through the same evolution now. Not only are many CSS Transitions demo pages already future proofed – see <a href=\"http://www.paulrhayes.com/experiments/parallax/#experiment\">Paul Hayes’ parallax effect</a> or <a href=\"http://leaverou.github.com/animatable/\">Lea Verou’s animatable gallery</a> – but open source projects such as <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/html5slides/\">Google’s html5slides</a>, <a href=\"http://davegamache.com/\">designers’ home pages</a>, <a href=\"http://www.impressivewebs.com/animating-css3-gradients/\">site logos</a> and <a href=\"http://www.impressivewebs.com/subtleties-css3-transitions/\">tutorials</a> routinely include unprefixed <code>transition</code> declarations. </p>\r\n<p>Many transition effects involve CSS Transforms, <a href=\"http://blog.typekit.com/2011/01/25/case-study-getting-hardboiled-with-css3-2d-transforms/\">tutorials</a> for which also frequently declare unprefixed <code>transform</code> properties. </p>\r\n<h2>Finishing the Specs</h2>\r\n<p>Even as Web developers anticipate browser convergence in their new markup, the standardization process is far more conservative. While <code>border-radius</code> worked interoperably enough for thousands of Web sites, members of the CSS Working Group were busy defining the rendering of more complex cases such as the appearance of a rounded corner between two adjacent borders of variable widths and colors. Likewise, the CSS <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transitions/\">Transitions</a>, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-animations/\">Animations</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transforms/\">Transforms</a> editors are working to <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=16806\">specify error conditions</a>, <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=14784\">fix errors</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=14658\">clarify less common scenarios</a>. </p> \r\n<p>While these issues must be resolved to ensure a high level of interoperability and to reach Recommendation status, relatively few of them will affect current and future content. Once a specification is stable and interoperable the web should not be held back by the last corner cases. This was not necessary for new HTML5 elements or to finalize the CSS2.1 spec, neither of which required prefixing. </p>\r\n<p>While solid specifications backed up by complete public test suites are critical, requiring all Web developers to repeat the same declarations multiple times until a Candidate Recommendation is published prioritizes spec completeness over content stability.</p>\r\n<p>Finishing a specification is a time-consuming effort. To take one example, CSS gradients <a href=\"http://www.webkit.org/blog/175/introducing-css-gradients/\">emerged in 2008</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/WD-css3-images-20090723/\">first Working Draft specifying an interoperable</a> solution in 2009 and the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-images/\">Candidate Recommendation was published  in April 2012</a>. In the meantime, the standardized syntax became incompatible with the prefixed syntax deployed on many Web sites. The Release Preview of IE10 is the first public unprefixed implementation of the latest spec. (IE10 also supports the more interoperable prefixed version with the <code>&#8209;ms&#8209;</code> vendor prefix.)</p>\r\n<h2>What It Means For Your Code</h2>\r\n<h3>CSS gradients</h3>\r\n<p>While broadly interoperable, the prefixed gradient syntax supported by all modern browsers reflects a now obsolete draft version of the specification. This earlier syntax is incompatible with the current Candidate Recommendation. For example, if you have declared the following gradient:</p>\r\n<code style=\"display: block; font-family: Consolas, Monospace; font-size: 13px; color: Black; text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\"><div style=\"background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">background: -ms-linear-gradient(left, yellow, red);</p></div></code>\r\n<p>Then producing the unprefixed equivalent is not simply a matter of removing the <code>&#8209;ms&#8209;</code> prefix. Because IE10's unprefixed linear gradient function conforms to the latest specification, it should become:</p>\r\n<code style=\"display: block; font-family: Consolas, Monospace; font-size: 13px; color: Black; text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\"><div style=\"background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">background: linear-gradient(to right, yellow, red);</p></div></code>\r\n<p>A future blog post will cover IE10’s support for CSS gradients in more detail.</p>\r\n<h3>Cascading and the CSS Object Model</h3>\r\n<p>The cascade will resolve prefixed CSS properties as expected; given the following rule (notice the higher rotation angle in the unprefixed declaration):</p>\r\n<code style=\"display: block; font-family: Consolas, Monospace; font-size: 13px; color: Black; text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\"><div style=\"background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">-ms-transform:</span> <span style=\"color: Maroon;\">rotate(30deg);</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">transform:</span> <span style=\"color: Maroon;\">rotate(60deg);</span></p>\r\n</div></code>\r\n<p>Your element will rotate 60 degrees: the two properties are treated as aliases of each other and the last declaration wins. Their corresponding CSSOM properties are also aliases: if you request the computed value of the <code>transform</code> and <code>msTransform</code> style properties they will both reflect the winning 60 degree transform. </p>\r\n<p>Likewise, setting <code>element.style.transform</code> will also set <code>element.style.msTransform</code> and vice-versa. </p>\r\n<h3>Serialization of property names</h3>\r\n<p>Properties such as <code>transition-property </code>take a list of CSS property names. For instance, to make the <code>transform</code> property transition over 2 seconds in IE10 Consumer Preview a developer would write:</p>\r\n<code style=\"display: block; font-family: Consolas, Monospace; font-size: 13px; color: Black; text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\"><div style=\"background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">-<span style=\"color: Maroon;\">ms-transition-property:</span> -<span style=\"color: Maroon;\">ms-transform;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">-<span style=\"color: Maroon;\">ms-transition-duration:</span> 2<span style=\"color: Maroon;\">s;</span></p>\r\n</div></code>\r\n<p>IE10 Release Preview will serialize the value of both <code>style.msTransitionProperty</code> and <code>style.transitionProperty</code> as ‘<code>transform</code>’. Note that the original prefix is not preserved. </p>\r\n<p>This is also true for the <code>propertyName</code> property of transition events.</p>\r\n<h3>Animation and Transition event type names</h3>\r\n<p>IE10 Release Preview allows the registration of Animation and Transition event listeners using both prefixed and unprefixed names i.e. the following are equivalent: </p>\r\n<code style=\"display: block; font-family: Consolas, Monospace; font-size: 13px; color: Black; text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\"><div style=\"background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">element.addEventListener(<span style=\"color: Maroon;\">&quot;MSTransitionEnd&quot;</span>, myHandler, <span style=\"color: Blue;\">false</span>);</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">element.addEventListener(<span style=\"color: Maroon;\">&quot;transitionend&quot;</span>, myHandler, <span style=\"color: Blue;\">false</span>);</p>\r\n</div></code>\r\n<p>But IE10 Release Preview will always return an unprefixed name in the <code>type</code> property of the event object.</p>\r\n<h2>What’s Next</h2>\r\n<p>We will submit new test cases to the W3C for all the features that IE10 now supports without a prefix. As Working Group members and co-editors, we will work with our colleagues to move these specifications forward to Candidate Recommendation.</p>\r\n<p>We welcome feedback you have on our support for these feature and their cross-browser compatibility.</p>\r\n<p>—Sylvain Galineau, Program Manager, Internet Explorer</p>\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div><img src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=10316058\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">"

8c6e5505-7562-269c-05d6-acb560eda0ab.description	"<p>With IE10 in Windows 8, we reimagined the browser. We designed and built IE10 to be the best way to experience the full Web on Windows. Consumers can now enjoy more touch-friendly, fast and fluid Web applications with the updated IE10 engine included in the <a href=\"http://preview.windows.com/\">Windows Release Preview</a>. This sixth Platform Preview of IE10 delivers improved performance and support for touch-first HTML5, as well as a new power-optimized, touch-friendly Adobe Flash Player that enables content on compatible Web sites to play in the Metro style Web browser. IE10 also sends the &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; signal to Web sites by default to help consumers protect their privacy.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\"><iframe width='720' height='404' frameborder='0' src='http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/ieblog/common/videoframe.htm?mp4=http://media.ch9.ms/ch9/1931/1b7645a7-bd9c-4e6f-bf0e-4862953c1931/IE10TestDriveReleasePreview_mid.mp4'></iframe><br /> This video shows some of the performance and touch improvements in the sixth IE10 Platform Preview, part of the Windows Release Preview.<br /> <a href=\"http://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/IE/Internet-Explorer-10-Test-Drive-on-Windows-8-Release-Preview\" target=\"_blank\">(This video is also available on Channel 9)</a></p>\r\n<p>You can read more about the improvements to the Metro style browsing experience on the <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8\">Building Windows 8</a> blog. The remainder of this post discusses the underlying HTML5 engine.</p>\r\n<p>Windows 8 includes one HTML5 browsing engine that powers both browsing experiences (the Metro style one and desktop one) as well as Metro style applications that use HTML5 and JavaScript. The common HTML5 engine provides consistently fast, safe, and powerful support for Web standards and the Web programming model, for both browser experiences as well as for Metro style applications.</p>\r\n<p>Consumers experience this power with responsive, touch-friendly pages that safely take full advantage of the underlying hardware. Some examples that you can try at the <a href=\"http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/\">IE Test Drive site</a> with the Consumer Preview include the Chalkboard Benchmark for common touch actions like panning and zooming and a multi-touch capable Web page for manipulating photos and images. You can read the full list in the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/gg192966\"> IE10 developer guide</a>.</p>\r\n<h3>Touch-friendly Adobe Flash in Metro style Internet Explorer 10</h3>\r\n<p>The Windows 8 Release Preview includes a new power-optimized, touch-friendly Adobe Flash Player. Adobe Flash content on compatible Web sites will now play in Metro style IE10. Metro style IE10 with Flash on Windows 8 enables people to see more of the Web working with high quality, especially compared with the experience in other touch-first or tablet experiences.</p>\r\n<p>We believe that having more sites &ldquo;just work&rdquo; in the Metro style browser improves the experience for consumers and businesses alike. As a practical matter, the primary device you walk around with should play the Web content on sites you rely on. Otherwise, the device is just a companion to a PC. Because some popular Web sites require Adobe Flash and do not offer HTML5 alternatives, Adobe and Microsoft worked together closely to deliver a Flash Player suitable for the Metro style experience.</p>\r\n<p>Both IE10 on the Windows desktop and Metro style IE use the same integrated Flash Player, with no need to download or install an additional player. IE10 on the desktop provides the same full Flash support as previous versions of IE that relied on the Flash Player plug-in, and continues to support other plug-ins. The Metro style browser continues to provide no support for other separate ActiveX controls or plug-ins.</p>\r\n<p>While any site can play Flash content in IE10 on the Windows desktop, only sites that are on the Compatibility View (<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/gg622935(v=vs.85).aspx\">CV</a>) list can play Flash content within Metro style IE. We place sites with Flash content on the CV list if doing so delivers the best user experience in Metro style IE with those sites. For example, how responsive is the content to touch? Does it work well with the onscreen keyboard, or affect battery life? Do visual prompts comply with the Metro style user experience guidelines? Sites that rely on capabilities (e.g. rollovers and P2P functionality) that are not supported within the Metro style experience, and don&rsquo;t degrade gracefully in their absence, are better off running in IE with Flash on the desktop. Site developers continue to control the content they serve to browsers. Developers can send HTML5 content to Metro style IE, or express their preference that Metro style IE prompt users to run their site on the desktop (see details <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2012/01/31/web-sites-and-a-plug-in-free-web.aspx\">here</a>).</p>\r\n<p>A good Flash Player experience is part of a no compromise experience across all form factors of PCs, including touch-centric PCs running Windows 8. We&rsquo;ve heard feedback from customers about their experience with sites that do not offer an HTML5 experience. For example, try pbskids.org on an iPad. Some workforce solutions, like <a href=\"https://www.beeline.com/\">Beeline</a>, require Flash. Some financial management sites, like <a href=\"https://www.benefitaccess.com/\">this one</a>, require Flash. And some sites still deliver their best experience with Flash, such as youtube.com.</p>\r\n<p>Adobe and Microsoft added support for touch gestures &ndash; like double tap and pinch to zoom &ndash; that work consistently across HTML5 and Flash. Adobe and Microsoft worked together to disable the desktop Flash functionality that is incompatible with touch, such as rollovers, within the Metro style experience. Much of Flash&rsquo;s other functionality works well with touch.</p>\r\n<p>Together we have also improved battery life with better support for <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2012/04/17/reclaiming-memory-from-metro-style-apps.aspx\"> PLM</a> in the Metro style experience. Flash on Windows has already supported offloading potentially battery-draining video work to specialized video hardware for some time (<a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/flashplayer/2011/03/adobe-supports-microsoft-ie-9.html\">link</a>). This work improves responsiveness and performance as well.</p>\r\n<p>Adobe and Microsoft have worked closely together for some time to address security and reliability issues (for example <a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/asset/2010/07/working-together.html\"> here</a>, and <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/sdl/archive/2009/06/17/microsoft-adobe-protecting-our-customers-together.aspx\">here</a>), sharing best practices like the <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/security/sdl\">SDL</a>/<a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/security/splc/\">SPLC</a> and ASLR as well as information on hangs and crashes. By updating Flash through Windows Update, like IE, we make security more convenient for customers. Microsoft and Adobe remain committed to meeting the expectations of Windows customers with regard to the delivery of security updates. We are also working together on accessibility, manageability, and privacy.</p>\r\n<p>The Flash Player included with Windows 8 is based on the full PC implementation and not a limited mobile subset, and there&rsquo;s a clear path to make it available on the new chip architectures that Windows 8 supports. Adobe is committed to delivering this same Flash Player support for Metro style IE on both x86/64 and the initial delivery of Windows RT PCs (Windows running on ARM processors).</p>\r\n<p>For the development community, platform continuity and technology choice are important. Flash in Metro style IE10 provides a bridge for existing sites to transition to HTML5 technologies where it makes sense and at a pace that is right for the experiences they want to deliver to their customers. HTML5 does not currently support, for example, some premium video content and game scenarios.</p>\r\n<p>We will provide additional technical information in the coming weeks through the regular documentation channels, like MSDN and <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/devnet.html\"> Adobe Developer Connection</a>. These details will include how developers can test Flash content on their own sites in Metro style IE, and how to submit their sites for consideration for the CV list. This documentation will also include a best practices guide to help developers, designers, and content publishers create experiences with Flash that plays well on Metro style IE. These best practices will complement existing recommendations on authoring touch-friendly HTML5 sites.</p>\r\n<h3>&ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; on By Default in IE in Windows 8</h3>\r\n<p>In Windows 8, IE10 sends a &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; signal to Web sites by default. Consumers can change this default setting if they choose. This decision reflects our commitment to providing Windows customers an experience that is &ldquo;private by default&rdquo; in an era when so much user data is collected online. IE10 is the first browser to send a &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; (DNT) signal by default.</p>\r\n<p>By changing the default Do Not Track setting in IE 10, we are broadening our commitment to providing consumers a great experience in Windows. And in the event companies don&rsquo;t respect the Do Not Track signal, IE 10 will continue to include Tracking Protection list support to help consumers block unwanted tracking with two clicks. While some people will say that this change is too much and others that it is not enough, we think it is progress and that consumers will favor products designed with their privacy in mind over products that are designed primarily to gather their data.</p>\r\n<p>You can read more about other actions underway with DNT <a href=\"http://blogs.technet.com/b/microsoft_on_the_issues/archive/2012/05/31/advancing-consumer-trust-and-privacy-internet-explorer-in-windows-8.aspx\"> here</a>.</p>\r\n<h3>Vendor prefixes, and moving the Web forward from experimental to stable</h3>\r\n<p>With the Release Preview of Windows 8, IE10 adds support for non-vendor prefixed versions of standards that have reached Candidate Recommendation (CR) status since the Windows 8 Consumer Preview or should reach CR in 2012.</p>\r\n<p>With this change, IE10 makes it easier for Web developers to write markup that works consistently across different browsers. Specifically, IE10 now supports the following W3C draft standards in their unprefixed form starting with the Release Preview: CSS transitions, transforms, animations, gradients, and CSS Fonts&rsquo; <code>font-feature-settings</code> property, as well as platform APIs such as the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/\">Indexed Database API</a> (<code>IndexedDB</code>) and <code>requestAnimationFrame()</code>.</p>\r\n<p>We selected these standards after examining <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh673549(v=vs.85).aspx\">all the W3C draft standards</a> IE10 supports and looking for standards that are stable (having no significant renaming or removal of properties/values expected), supported and interoperable across at least two browsers other than IE10 for the features&rsquo; core use cases, and already in use on the Web, including in their unprefixed form.</p>\r\n<p>Browser vendors generally drop the vendor prefix once a specification reaches CR. For compatibility with sites and apps developed using the Windows 8 Consumer Preview and that rely on the Microsoft vendor prefix, IE10 continues to support the <code style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">-ms-</code> vendor-prefixed forms as well. Note that IE10 continues to support only the vendor-prefixed form of several other standards because these specifications are not yet sufficiently stable and interoperable, for example <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-flexbox/\"> CSS Flexible Box Layout</a>.</p>\r\n<p>As a best practice, developers typically add an unprefixed version of a property to &ldquo;future-proof&rdquo; their pages. The following set of declarations is now ready for future browsers that support unprefixed CSS Transforms:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: red;\">-webkit-transform</span>: <span style=\"color: blue;\">rotate(30deg)</span>;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: red;\">-moz-transform</span>: <span style=\"color: blue;\">rotate(30deg)</span>;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: red;\">-ms-transform</span>: <span style=\"color: blue;\">rotate(30deg)</span>;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: red;\">-o-transform</span>: <span style=\"color: blue;\">rotate(30deg)</span>;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: red;\">transform</span>: <span style=\"color: blue;\">rotate(30deg)</span>;</code></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h3>Other Key Platform Changes</h3>\r\n<p>In the Release Preview, we continue to improve performance. Web pages should just &ldquo;stick to your finger&rdquo; and remain fast and fluid while panning, zooming, and scaling content. The Chalkboard Benchmark shows the results of some of our performance work. It measures how efficiently a browser can perform these common touch actions by zooming in and out of a &ldquo;chalkboard&rdquo; while panning left, right, up, and then down. IE10&rsquo;s performance here is a great example of Internet Explorer&rsquo;s hardware acceleration in action.</p>\r\n<p>Performance improvements contribute to great touch support, for example with full independent composition of Web page contents (fixed elements, subscrollers, animations, and video). We&rsquo;ve also improved performance on low-end hardware; intensive sites now show much less flashing and flickering on low-end hardware. These improvements make IE10&rsquo;s support for full screen video playback (in both HTML5 video and Adobe Flash Player) even better.</p>\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve continued to improve the performance of the Chakra JavaScript engine. JavaScript intensive Web applications, like HTML5 games, will benefit from dynamic profile-based JIT, type-specialized code generation for floating point numbers, expansion of function inlining, and further tuning to reduce the idle memory footprint while reducing the observable pauses due to garbage collection.</p>\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve also improved standards support in a number of ways. IE10 now has support for IVS/Emoji characters and the <code>classList</code> API and new <code>reverse</code> and <code>alternate-reverse</code> values of the <code>animation-direction</code> CSS property. DOM exceptions match the W3C WebIDL spec, and developers can use a constructor to create <code>Blob</code> objects, matching the W3C spec. We&rsquo;ve also removed legacy DX filters from all modes.</p>\r\n<p>HTML5 applications and sites can do more with touch via the <code>MSGesture</code> APIs that provide instantiable gesture event handling.</p>\r\n<h3>A Better Web Today, and Ahead</h3>\r\n<p>The opportunities continue for HTML5 to make both Web sites and applications better. Those opportunities are exciting for everyone on the Web.</p>\r\n<p>To get to that Web sooner, we continue to recommend that developers update old and out of date patterns on their sites. Looking at the CV list you can find examples of sites that need <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shim_(computing)\">shimming</a> because they use out of date libraries (e.g. <a href=\"http://Thetimes.co.uk\"> here</a>) or rely on browser detection rather than feature detection. The compatibility problem reports we receive have more to do with sites detecting IE and sending it different content than they send other browsers than any particular issue in IE. Developers can find sample feature detection code patterns in several IE blog posts, including <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/09/13/ie10pp3.aspx\">this one</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The quality and correctness of different browsers&rsquo; HTML5 engines continue to vary widely. We will submit updates to test cases to the W3C for all the features that IE10 now supports without a prefix. As members and co-editors of the CSS Working Group, we will work with our colleagues to move these specifications forward to Candidate Recommendation. We continue to contribute to the <a href=\"http://w3c-test.org/html/tests/reporting/report.htm\">test suites</a> under development at the HTML5 standards bodies to further the goal of interoperability and same markup. We&rsquo;ve submitted and updated over <a href=\"http://samples.msdn.microsoft.com/ietestcenter/\"> 240 tests</a> to them that you can view at the IE Test Center as well. As different browsers improve their support of the same markup to produce the same results, we can all realize the promise of HTML5.</p>\r\n<p>You can find a full list of new functionality available to developers in the IE10 developer guide <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/gg192966\">here</a>. Download the <a href=\"http://windows.microsoft.com/release-preview\">Windows 8 Release Preview</a> to try this update to IE10.

48374344-7a76-52dd-4b83-047685f1bf55.description	"<p>Sharing a link to a Web page is a common activity on the PC, and it gets better with IE10 on Windows 8. One of the new features on Windows 8 is the Share charm, which allows you to seamlessly send content between apps on your PC. Previously, if you wanted to share an interesting article with your friend, or post a funny picture on your blog, you’d copy the link from the address bar, switch to a different site or app, and then paste it. Now, with the Windows 8 Share charm, you can share directly from the browser without ever leaving your current page.</p>\r\n<p>When you use the Share charm to share a site from the browser, IE10 creates two data formats that contain relevant content – the URI, and some HTML that includes a rich representation of the page. Here are two examples of data that get shared for a YouTube video:</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 0.25in;\">The URI (of the current site)</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><code>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DbgiOCTQts</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 0.25in;\">The HTML (with a link preview)</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\"><img style=\"max-width: 85%; padding: 12px; border: 1px solid #999; box-shadow: 3px 3px 8px 0px hsla(0, 0%, 0%, 0.25);\" alt=\"An example of IE10&#39;s rich preview of Web pages\" src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/2313.gysrfswi_2D00_gysrfswi_2D00_image1_2D00_1_5F00_521x115.png\" /><br />An example of IE10's rich preview of Web pages</p>\r\n<p>Both of these data formats are created for an “implicit” share, which is the name for what happens when you share the site that you are currently viewing. Since Web pages can be represented as hyperlinks or a rich HTML link preview, IE10 includes both types of data. Of course, if you aren’t sharing the whole page, but rather, some content that you’ve highlighted, IE10 will share the HTML of your selection instead of the URI and the link preview. In this case, sharing a selection would be called an “explicit” share, and does not include the link. This post describes the link sharing case, how IE10 participates in the Windows 8 Share contract using HTML, and how Web developers can create link previews with just a few meta-tags.</p>\r\n<h2>The Share Charm and IE10</h2>\r\n<p>Here’s a video of how a user might share links from the browser to an app that uses HTML.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\">\r\n    <iframe width='640' height='360' frameborder='0' src='http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/ieblog/common/videoframe.htm?mp4=http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-video/0511.SharingLinkPreviews_2800_Yelp_2900_.mp4'></iframe><br />\r\n               Sharing from IE10: Link Previews in Action</p>\r\n<p>In this video, “Stash” is a sample link saving app that makes use of the Windows share charm with HTML. The sample app simply supports the HTML data format for sharing, and IE provides the link preview. Link previews are HTML that contains a title, image, and description for every shared link. This makes it easy for you to recognize the site content. If you have <a href=\"http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/download\">Windows 8 Consumer Preview</a> and <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/11/en-us/downloads\">Visual Studio 11 Beta</a>, you can <a href=\"http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Browser/Windows8Share/DownloadDemoApp.html\" target=\"_blank\">download and run Stash</a> on your own PC. Stash integrates with the Windows 8 Share contract as a target app, as you can see below. Below, you can see a high-level diagram that shows how links are shared from IE10.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\"><img style=\"max-width: 95%; padding: 8px; border: 1px solid #999; box-shadow: 3px 3px 8px 0px hsla(0, 0%, 0%, 0.25);\" alt=\"Diagram showing sharing a link from IE10 to target apps, using the Share charm’s data package\" src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/7028.gysrfswi_2D00_image1_5F00_760x385.png\" /><br />Diagram: Sharing a link from IE10 to target apps, using the Share charm’s data package</p>\r\n<p>Windows 8 Share charm handles the coordination between the source and target apps to provide an integrated sharing experience across all apps. This removes the need for target and source apps to be aware and coordinate between each other. </p>\r\n<h2>Sharing the Web is Better, Start to Finish</h2>\r\n<p>The Web is made up of HTML. That’s why HTML is one of the most important data formats in IE10’s integration with the Share contract. IE10 creates link previews to both provide a better sharing experience for users, and to help connect Web developers to Windows 8 Share. With a little extra meta-data markup, sites can define what information is included in their link previews. On the other end of the share contract, target apps that support the HTML data format can get the full experience of contextual Web hyperlinks without having to parse a single site. The end result is a rich, modern, and fluid sharing experience, from end to end.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\"><img style=\"max-width: 95%; border: 1px solid #999; box-shadow: 3px 3px 8px 0px hsla(0, 0%, 0%, 0.25);\" alt=\"Screenshot of target apps available in Share pane\" src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/6840.gysrfswi_2D00_image2_5F00_760x475.png\" /><br />Screenshot of target apps available in Share pane</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\"><img style=\"max-width: 95%; border: 1px solid #999; box-shadow: 3px 3px 8px 0px hsla(0, 0%, 0%, 0.25);\" alt=\"Screenshot of Stash’s Share Pane\" src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/4885.gysrfswi_2D00_image3_5F00_760x475.png\" /><br />Screenshot of Stash’s Share Pane</p>\r\n<p>When you share a Web site, IE10 parses that site to create a link preview. In the example above, it’s a short snippet of content that represents a movie page on IMDb. The goal of sharing HTML, in addition to the URI, is to share the best possible representation of what the user intended to share, so IE10 creates link previews for all implicit shares. The benefits of HTML are that it can include more information than a URI, and the content of the HTML is more meaningful than a hyperlink. In the words of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Knope\">Leslie Knope</a>, no one wants to share that “complicated nonsense.”</p>\r\n<div style=\"position: relative; height: auto;\">\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\"><img style=\"max-width: 95%; border: 1px solid #999; box-shadow: 3px 3px 8px 0px hsla(0, 0%, 0%, 0.25);\" alt=\"Frame grab from the NBC show Parks and Recreation. Character Ron Swanson is holding a Knope for City Council sign most of which is long, complicated URL.

For example, blogging apps can take advantage of rich HTML content, and SMS apps would do best to use the URI. Developers of Metro style apps choose the data format(s) that make most sense for their app to receive, following the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh771179.aspx\">Windows 8 Share guidance</a>. </p>\r\n<h2>Sites Use Markup to Define What IE10 Shares</h2>\r\n<p>Since IE10 uses existing markup meant for sharing on the Web, many sites will already look great when sharing HTML link previews on Windows 8. We support the <a href=\"http://ogp.me/\">Open Graph protocol</a> as a simple way to add meta-data about the page. When users share sites on Facebook and through Windows 8 and IE10, you can use OpenGraph to control the way your Web page appears to others. </p>\r\n<p>Here’s an example of <a href=\"http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Performance/BrickBreaker/\" target=\"_blank\">an IE test drive demo</a> that uses this markup:</p>\r\n<code style=\"display: block; font-family: Consolas, Monospace; font-size: 13px; color: Black; text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\"><div style=\"background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">head</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">meta</span> <span style=\"color: Red;\">name</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">=&quot;description&quot;</span> <span style=\"color: Red;\">content</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">=&quot;Brick Breaker TestDrive Demo Game, Performance and Touch benchmark&quot;</span> <span style=\"color: Blue;\">/&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">title</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&gt;</span>Brick Breaker<span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;/</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">title</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">meta</span> <span style=\"color: Red;\">property</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">=&quot;og:image&quot;</span> <span style=\"color: Red;\">content</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">=&quot;Views/Homepage/Icons/BrickBreaker.png&quot;</span> <span style=\"color: Blue;\">/&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;/</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">head</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&gt;</span></p>\r\n</div></code>\r\n<p>IE looks for the following tags in the site’s markup to create the page’s link preview.</p>\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\r\n<tr><th>Property</th>\r\n<th>HTML tag</th>\r\n<th>Character limit</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr><td>Title 1</td>\r\n<td>&lt;meta name=\"title\" content=\"Insert Site Title Here” /&gt;</td>\r\n<td>160</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr><td>Title 2</td>\r\n<td>&lt;title&gt;Insert Site Title Here&lt;/title&gt;</td>\r\n<td>160</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr><td>Description</td>\r\n<td>&lt;meta name=\"description\" content=\"Insert Site Description Here” /&gt;</td>\r\n<td>253</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr><td>Image 1</td>\r\n<td>&lt;meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"insert_image_link_here\" /&gt;</td>\r\n<td>2,048 (limit for image URI)</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr><td>Image 2</td>\r\n<td>&lt;link rel=\"image_src\" href=\"insert_image_link_here\" /&gt;</td>\r\n<td>2,048 (limit for image URI)</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr><td>Image 3</td>\r\n<td>&lt;meta name=\"image\" content=\"insert_image_link_here\" /&gt;</td>\r\n<td>2,048 (limit for image URI)</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr><td>Image 4</td>\r\n<td>&lt;meta name=\"thumbnail\" content=\"insert_image_link_here\" /&gt;</td>\r\n<td>2,048 (limit for image URI)</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>Note that this is the order in which we parse for each attribute. For example, if both Image 1 and Image 2 tags are present, we’ll use the Image 1 tag. Additionally, if more than one tag of any type is present, we use the first one you list in your markup.</p>\r\n<p>For character limits, if the description is longer than the maximum length, IE will put a “…” at the end in the preview.</p>\r\n<p>Make sure to include at least one of each property in your site markup to get your pages looking great for sharing in Windows 8. See <a href=\"http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Browser/Windows8Share/\" target=\"_blank\">this demo on the IE Test Drive site</a> for more on how the markup works.</p>\r\n<h2>Apps Get the Benefit of a Powerful Web Browser</h2>\r\n<p>If your app supports the Share target app contract, you should consider whether it makes sense for it to support HTML as a shared data format. Apps that use HTML can benefit from the link previews shared by IE10 because IE10 does all of the heavy lifting. It parses the site and puts together a short and informative link preview, and all your app needs to do is display and host the HTML. The hyperlink is embedded within the preview, so it functions just like a Uri, but looks much better. This way, apps that don’t have the resources to parse the Web to condense pages into small, rich previews, can still display contextual links as HTML.  </p>\r\n<p>Many apps, in addition to IE10, will share HTML. Target apps that accept HTML must be agnostic about the source of the shared data. As noted above, IE10 shares HTML for both implicit and explicit sharing scenarios, so sometimes the HTML is a link preview, and sometimes it’s a user selection. In either case, the content of the HTML is the best possible representation of what the user intended to share. Here’s a snippet of what the link preview HTML generated by IE10 will look like when it’s added to the Share charm’s Data Package:</p>\r\n<code style=\"display: block; font-family: Consolas, Monospace; font-size: 13px; color: Black; text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\"><div style=\"background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">html</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">body</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">style</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">/* IE10</span>\\uc1\\u8217?s metro-style CSS attributes */</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;/</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">style</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">a</span> <span style=\"color: Red;\">class</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">=&quot;snippet-URL&quot;</span> <span style=\"color: Red;\">href</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">=&quot;http://site_link_goes_here&quot;&gt;</span>Website Title goes here<span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;/</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">a</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">table</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">tr</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 10em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">td</span> <span style=\"color: Red;\">class</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">=&quot;snippet-image&quot;&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 12em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">img</span> <span style=\"color: Red;\">src</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">=&quot;image_link_goes_here&quot;</span> <span style=\"color: Blue;\">/&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 10em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;/</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">td</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 10em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">td</span> <span style=\"color: Red;\">class</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">=&quot;snippet-text&quot;&gt;</span>Website description goes here <span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;/</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">td</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;/</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">tr</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;/</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">table</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">&lt;!--EndFragment--&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;/</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">body</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;/</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">html</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&gt;</span></p>\r\n</div></code>\r\n<p>For an example of an app that uses HTML from IE10, <a href=\"http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Browser/Windows8Share/DownloadDemoApp.html\" target=\"_blank\">download the sample app “Stash”</a> seen in the video above.

a5b67c65-01a3-3229-f5ed-ccbab33bf3c5.description	"<p>IE10 in <a href=\"http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/consumer-preview\">Windows 8 Consumer Preview</a> includes support for <code>Error.stack</code>, which enables Web developers to diagnose and correct bugs faster, especially those that are difficult to reproduce. Developers can build amazing apps with the capabilities of Web platforms that power today’s modern browsers. In Windows 8, we expose that power through both Internet Explorer 10 and <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/br211385.aspx\">Metro style apps in JavaScript</a>. The increasing power and complexity of these apps means developers need better tools like <code>Error.stack</code> for handling errors and diagnosing bugs. </p>\r\n<h2>Debugging Applications</h2>\r\n<p>Structured error handling in JavaScript rests on <code>throw</code> and <code>try/catch</code> – where the developer declares an error and passes the control flow to a portion of the program that deals with error handling. When an error is thrown, Chakra, the JavaScript engine in Internet Explorer, captures the chain of calls that led up to where the error originated – also referred to as the call stack. If the object being thrown is an <code>Error</code> (or is a function whose prototype chain leads back to <code>Error</code>), Chakra creates a stack trace, a human-readable listing of the call stack. This listing is represented as a property, <code>stack</code>, on the <code>Error</code> object. The <code>stack</code> includes the error message, function names, and source file location information of the functions. This information can help developers rapidly diagnose defects by learning what function was being called, and even see what line of code was at fault. For example, it might indicate that a parameter passed into the function was null or an invalid type.</p>\r\n<p>Let’s explore with an example of a simple script that attempts to calculate the distance between two points, <code>(0, 2)</code> and <code>(12, 10)</code>:</p>\r\n<code style=\"display: block; font-family: Consolas, Monospace; font-size: 13px; color: Black; text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\"><div style=\"background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">(<span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span> () {</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">&#39;use strict&#39;</span>;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span> squareRoot(n) {</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">if</span> (n &lt; 0)</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 10em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">throw</span> <span style=\"color: Blue;\">new</span> Error(<span style=\"color: Maroon;\">&#39;Cannot take square root of negative number.&#39;</span>);</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 2em\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">return</span> Math.sqrt(n);</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">}</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 2em\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span> square(n) {</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">return</span> n * n;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">}</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 2em\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span> pointDistance(pt1, pt2) {</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">return</span> squareRoot((pt1.x - pt2.x) + (pt1.y - pt2.y));</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">}</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 2em\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span> sample() {</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">var</span> pt1 = { x: 0, y: 2 };</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">var</span> pt2 = { x: 12, y: 10 };</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 2em\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\">console.log(<span style=\"color: Maroon;\">&#39;Distance is: &#39;</span> + pointDistance(pt1, pt2));</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">}</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 2em\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">try</span> {</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\">sample();</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">}</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">catch</span> (e) {</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\">console.log(e.stack);</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">}</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">})();</p>\r\n</div></code>\r\n<p>This script has a bug – it forgets to square the differences of the components. As a result, for some inputs, the <code>pointDistance</code> function will simply return incorrect results; other times, it will cause an error. To understand the stack trace, let’s examine the error in the F12 developer tools and look at its Script tab:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\"><img style=\"max-width: 95%; border: 1px solid #999; box-shadow: 3px 3px 8px 0px hsla(0, 0%, 0%, 0.25);\" alt=\"Screen shot of the F12 developer tools showing a stack trace logged by calling console.log(e.stack) where e is the Error object passed to the catch clause of a try/catch block.\" src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/8037.djewes_2D00_image1_5F00_760x421.png\" /></p>\r\n<p>The stack trace is dumped to the console in the <code>catch</code> clause, and because it’s at the top of the stack, it’s readily apparent that the Error is originating in the <code>squareRoot</code> function. To debug the problem, a developer wouldn’t have to go very deep into the stack trace; <code>squareRoot</code>’s precondition was violated, and looking one level up the stack, it’s clear why: the sub-expressions within the call to <code>squareRoot</code> should themselves be parameters to <code>square</code>. </p>\r\n<p>While debugging, the <code>stack</code> property can help identify code for setting a breakpoint. Bear in mind that there are other ways to view the call stack: for instance, if you set the script debugger to “Break on caught exception” mode, you may be able to inspect the call stack with the debugger. For deployed applications, you may consider wrapping problematic code within <code>try/catch</code> in order to capture failed calls, and log them to your server. Developers would then be able to look at the call stack to help isolate problem areas.</p>\r\n<h3>DOM Exceptions and Error.stack</h3>\r\n<p>I noted previously that the object being thrown must be an <code>Error</code> or lead back to <code>Error</code> via its prototype chain. This is intentional; JavaScript supports throwing any object and even primitives as exceptions. While all of these can be caught and examined, they are not all specifically designed to contain error or diagnostic information. As a consequence, only Errors will be updated with a <code>stack</code> property when thrown. </p>\r\n<p>Even though DOM Exceptions are objects, they don’t have prototype chains that lead back to <code>Error</code>, and therefore they don’t have a <code>stack</code> property. In scenarios in which you are performing DOM manipulation and want to surface JavaScript-compatible errors, you may want to wrap your DOM manipulation code within a <code>try/catch </code>block, and throw a new <code>Error</code> object within the <code>catch</code> clause:</p>\r\n<code style=\"display: block; font-family: Consolas, Monospace; font-size: 13px; color: Black; text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\"><div style=\"background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span> causesDomError() {</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">try</span> {</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">var</span> div = document.createElement(<span style=\"color: Maroon;\">&#39;div&#39;</span>);</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\">div.appendChild(div);</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">} <span style=\"color: Blue;\">catch</span> (e) {</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">throw</span> <span style=\"color: Blue;\">new</span> Error(e.toString());</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">}</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">}</p>\r\n</div></code>\r\n<p>However, you will probably want to consider whether you want to use this pattern. It is likely best-suited for utility library development; specifically, consider whether your code’s intent is to hide DOM manipulation, or to simply carry out a task. If it is hiding DOM manipulation, wrapping the manipulation and throwing an <code>Error</code> is probably the right way to go.</p>\r\n<h3>Performance Considerations</h3>\r\n<p>The construction of the stack trace begins when the error object is thrown; doing so requires walking the current execution stack. To prevent performance problems in traversing a particularly large stack (possibly even a recursive stack chain), by default, IE only collects the top 10 stack frames. This setting is configurable, however, by setting the static property <code>Error.stackTraceLimit</code> to another value. This setting is global, and must be changed <code>prior to throwing the error</code>, or else it will not have an effect on stack traces. </p>\r\n<h3>Asynchronous Exceptions</h3>\r\n<p>When a stack trace is generated from an asynchronous callback (for example, a <code>timeout</code>, <code>interval</code>, or <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>), the asynchronous callback, rather than the code that created the asynchronous callback, will be at the bottom of the call stack. This has some potential implications for tracking down offending code: if you use the same callback function for multiple asynchronous callbacks, you may find it difficult to determine by inspection alone which callback caused the error. Let’s slightly modify our previous sample so that, instead of calling <code>sample()</code> directly, we’ll put that into a timeout callback:</p>\r\n<code style=\"display: block; font-family: Consolas, Monospace; font-size: 13px; color: Black; text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\"><div style=\"background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">(<span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span> () {</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">&#39;use strict&#39;</span>;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span> squareRoot(n) {</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">if</span> (n &lt; 0)</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 10em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">throw</span> <span style=\"color: Blue;\">new</span> Error(<span style=\"color: Maroon;\">&#39;Cannot take square root of negative number.&#39;</span>);</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 2em\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">return</span> Math.sqrt(n);</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">}</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 2em\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span> square(n) {</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">return</span> n * n;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">}</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 2em\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span> pointDistance(pt1, pt2) {</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">return</span> squareRoot((pt1.x - pt2.x) + (pt1.y - pt2.y));</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">}</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 2em\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span> sample() {</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">var</span> pt1 = { x: 0, y: 2 };</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">var</span> pt2 = { x: 12, y: 10 };</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 2em\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\">console.log(<span style=\"color: Maroon;\">&#39;Distance is: &#39;</span> + pointDistance(pt1, pt2));</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">}</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 2em\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">setTimeout(<span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span> () {</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">try</span> {</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 10em;\">sample();</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\">}</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">catch</span> (e) {</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 10em;\">console.log(e.stack);</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\">}</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">}, 2500);</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">})();</p>\r\n</div></code>\r\n<p>Upon executing this snippet, you’ll see the stack trace come up after a slight delay. This time, you’ll also see that the bottom of the stack is not Global<code> </code>Code but rather is <code>Anonymous function</code>. In fact, it’s not the same anonymous function, but the callback function passed into <code>setTimeout</code>. Since you lose the context surrounding hooking up the callback, you may not be able to determine what is causing the callback to be called. If you consider a scenario in which one callback is registered to handle the <code>click</code> event of many different buttons, you will be unable to tell to which callback the registration refers to. That being said, this limitation is only minor, because, in most cases, the top of the stack will likely highlight the problem areas.</p>\r\n<h2>Exploring the Test Drive Demo</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\"><img style=\"max-width: 95%; border: 1px solid #999; box-shadow: 3px 3px 8px 0px hsla(0, 0%, 0%, 0.25);\" alt=\"Screen shot of Test Drive demo Explore Error.stack\" src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/2654.Test_2D00_Drive_2D00_Screen_2D00_Capture.png\" /></p>\r\n<p>Check out this <a href=\"http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/browser/ExploreErrorStack/\">Test Drive demo</a> using IE10 in the <a href=\"http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/consumer-preview\">Windows 8 Consumer Preview</a>.

d9d93fc3-6ef7-883b-52eb-01207c456ab3.description	"<p>Today is Alan Turing&#8217;s 100th birthday. I&#8217;ve been thinking about him lately, in particular about a story that demonstrates the perils of working with genius.</p>\n<p>The story goes that, when Turing was working with the Manchester Baby (the first stored program computer ever built. Just) a colleague wrote the first ever assembler which would turn (relatively) human readable assembly language and turn it into the ones and zeroes of machine code that the machine could actually execute. He showed it to Turing, who blew up at him, ranting that using the computer to do &#8216;trivial&#8217; jobs like that were a massive waste of expensive computer time.</p>\n<p>The problem with working with a genius, from the point of view of more ordinary mortals, is that the genius has only a very rough idea of what is actually easy, and what is only easy to them. From today&#8217;s vantage point, when computers are as freely available as they are now, the idea of <em>not</em> letting the computer do the shitwork for you seems utterly ludicrous &#8211; programmer time is more valuable than computer time.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s less obvious is that the same was true in Turing&#8217;s time (when there was precisely one computer) too. It only takes one programmer to make a mistake in translating from assembler to machine code and run a job that, for instance, gets stuck in an infinite loop and you&#8217;ve probably wasted more computer time (and programmer time) than if you&#8217;d just run it through the assembler in the first place. Turing didn&#8217;t see that, because the process of translating from symbols to binary wasn&#8217;t something that he found particularly complicated. To him, what was needed wasn&#8217;t more and better tools, it was more and better Turings.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not entirely sure that I believe the story (and I can&#8217;t remember where I heard it, so it may be a phantom of my memory). It certainly doesn&#8217;t chime with the Turing who was instrumental in mechanising the shitwork of finding the days rotor settings so that Enigma traffic could be cracked. The history of Bletchley Park is a story of building better and better machines to do the dully repetitive jobs that humans find so hard to stick to and which machines excel at.</p>\n<p>The &#8220;Just write code without bugs in the first place&#8221; school of programming is alive and well today. It&#8217;s not my school though. I&#8217;m very much an exploratory coder. I like to have tests to show me the way and to keep me honest so that I don&#8217;t go breaking things when I change this bit here. I&#8217;ve customised my editing environment to help me as much as possible. I have a nasty habit of writing bare words that I should have quoted, so I have a keystroke that shoves the last word into quotes for me. Another keystroke will align all the broad arrows at the current level of nesting. I&#8217;ve got snippets set up that fill in standard boilerplate when I start a new class, a huge list of common spelling mistakes that get autocorrected while I&#8217;m not looking and an expanding list of other little helpers that I need to write when I get around to it. Automation lets me go faster, make more and better mistakes and recover from them faster. I am a of little brain and I want all the help I can give myself.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure that Turing would be in the same camp as me.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the thing though &#8211; Turing was, definitely, a genius. But his paper &#8220;On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem&#8221; (the one that gave the world the Turing Machine) has a bug in it. In fact, it has two. The first is obvious enough that I spotted it when i read the paper for the first time. The second bug is rather more subtle (but still fixable. It&#8217;s okay, the field of computing is not build on sand).</p>\n<p>I love that The Paper &#8211; The one that&#8217;s the theoretical basis for the modern world (first publishd 75 years ago, round(ish) number fans) &#8211; has a bug. It gives me a strange kind of hope. Fallibility gets us all &#8211; even people who have saved the world. I think we should celebrate the humanity as well as the genius. Turing was, by all accounts, a very odd fish, but the world is undeniably richer for his contributions.</p>\n<p>So, let&#8217;s raise a glass to the memory of Alan Turing tonight, marathon runner, gay icon, saviour of the world and the pleasantly fallible inventor of the modern world. Not a bad CV, when you think about it.</p>\n<h4>Updated</h4>\n<p>Apparently I&#8217;m wrong about it being Turing who didn&#8217;t like the assembler but Von Neumann (another genius). See below for details. And phew! How nice to find that a hero doesn&#8217;t have feet of clay.</p>"

It just so happened that <span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span> (Yet Another Perl Conference) was held in Asheville this year, the week before the gathering&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.swangathering.com/Catalog/TS/sgtssched.html\">Traditional Song Week</a>. Well, I&#8217;m a perl hacker. I sing traditional songs. My employer was paying for me to attend <span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span> and were willing for me to extend my stay in America by a week. It was a no brainer really.</p>\n<p><span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span> was bloody good this year. Perl 5 development is moving forward and the community is buzzing because of it. Lots of &#8220;… and we&#8217;re hiring&#8221; slides. And that&#8217;s before we get to the pleasure of catching up with friends that I only see online most of the time. If you&#8217;re working in any field that has grassroots conferences associated with it, I can&#8217;t recommend attending them highly enough.</p>\n<h3>On to Swannanoa</h3>\n<p>At Swannanoa, I met Sheila Kay Adams and immediately switched my schedule to spend as much time singing with her as possible. Sheila&#8217;s a seventh generation ballad singer from the Sodom Laurel community in Madison Count. Her &#8220;grannie Berzil&#8221; Wallin remembered Cecil Sharp coming to Madison County and collecting songs from the family.</p>\n<p>Pedigree in singing shouldn&#8217;t matter, but it turns out it does. Sheila grew up in a community which was changing, but which still had old &#8216;love songs&#8217; as an important part of how it understood the world. Today, not so much. People still relate to the world and understand it through songs, but the songs are more likely to be contemporary. Lyrically, many of the love songs that Sheila and her family sing could have been written yesterday, but their performance is radically different from contemporary style. One voice, unaccompanied, a style that requires the listener to concentrate on the song rather than any aspects of production. Not something you&#8217;re going to dance to at your wedding, say.</p>\n<p>Sheila&#8217;s classes, on Meeting House Songs (more later) and her Ballads class with Bobbie McMillon were just wonderful; I won&#8217;t forget in a hurry the sound Bobbie singing &#8220;A conversation with Death&#8221; as a thunderstorm grumbled across the campus in the background. Spine tingling stuff. Sheila&#8217;s description of how she learned songs &#8220;knee to knee&#8221; has been helpful too. The way it would work was that the teacher and student would be sat out on the porch, often doing some chore or another, and the teacher would sing the first verse of a song. The student would sing it back and the teacher would sing the second verse. The student would then sing the first two verses then the teacher would sing the third verse and the student would sing the first three verses and so on, until the student was singing the whole song back to the teacher. A time consuming process to be sure, but it works.</p>\n<p>I know this because I learned Pretty Saro from a recording of Sheila&#8217;s late husband Jim Taylor, using a variant of the method, &#8220;knee to CD&#8221; if you like. I&#8217;d play the first verse, hit pause and sing it back, play the second verse, pause, repeat the first two… and so on. And in very short order I had the words and tune (up to a point; I listened back to that recording again recently and I&#8217;m singing a different tune now) and could start the process of actually <em>learning</em> the song, which involved singing it it lots, listening to other recordings, singing it some more and then taking the song out and trying it out in front of audiences and listening to what works and what doesn&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve never really finished learning a song; this recording is a snapshot. I hope you enjoy it.</p>"

61a4a766-f9a9-c933-347f-498c80ae9872.description	"<p>I sometimes think that I should have published the lyrics to <a href=\"http://www.bofh.org.uk/child-of-the-library\">Child of the Library</a> with a bibliography. The references in the second verse are all obvious to me, but I&#8217;m a white middle class English boy who grew up around boats. My childhood reading and yours may not intersect all that much.</p>\n<p>So&#8230;</p>\n<h4>The Walkers and the Blacketts</h4>\n<p>Also known as the <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=intitle:%22Swallows+and+Amazons%22\">Swallows and Amazons.</a> <cite>Swallows and Amazons</cite> is the first &#8216;big&#8217; book that I can remember reading for myself. We were in Cornwall, holidaying at the same place my mum&#8217;s been going to since she was a kid. Mum was reading <cite>Swallows and Amazons</cite> to us, and it was great, but I was impatient to find out what happened next, so I took the book to bed with me and read it for myself. I haven&#8217;t stopped yet. <cite>Swallows and Amazons</cite> was the book that opened my door to reading for pleasure. It opened up a way of looking at the world too. I can&#8217;t imagine who I&#8217;d be if I&#8217;d never read any Ransome.</p>\n<h4>The Pevensies</h4>\n<p>The Pevensies are the family in <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=intitle:%22The+Lion+The+Witch+And+The+Wardrobe%22\">The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe,</a> the first of the Narnia books. I have a slightly troubled relationship with these books now. I <em>really</em> don&#8217;t get on with C. S. Lewis&#8217;s view of the world (I once hurled a taped reading of <cite>The Screwtape Letters</cite> out of the car rather than listen to another word of the bloody things), but I wasn&#8217;t reading between the lines when I was nine. I was just loving the stories and the images they put in my head. And what images&#8230;</p>\n<h4>Simp, the Canine Cannonball</h4>\n<p>What do you mean, you&#8217;ve never read <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=intitle:%22Cannonball+Simp%22\">Cannonball Simp?</a> You poor thing!</p>\n<p><cite>Cannonball Simp</cite>, by John Burningham is <em>the</em> library book for me. Back when I was 4 or 5, I would walk with my dad from Regent&#8217;s Square to the Doncaster Central Library every Saturday morning, with three books clutched under my arm. I&#8217;d hand them over the counter, receiving in exchange 3 buff cardboard library slip holders. I would then go over to the childrens&#8217; books section and pull out three new (to me) books and take them to the counter. The librarian would remove the slip from the library bookplate, place it in one of my surrendered holders and stamp the slip and the bookplate with the date, three weeks hence, by which the book must be renewed.</p>\n<p>Well, that&#8217;s how it worked until weekend I came back with <cite>Cannonball Simp</cite>. I <em>loved</em> it. I didn&#8217;t want to take it back because I hadn&#8217;t learned it yet. Sure I could &#8216;read&#8217; along with Dad &#8211; I knew all the words by then &#8211; but the pictures were another thing entirely. They were <em>beautiful</em>. They still are.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s when I learned of the magic of &#8216;renewal&#8217;. Instead of handing the book back, I showed it to the librarian and said &#8220;I&#8217;d like to renew this, please,&#8221; and instead of giving me my library card back, they just stamped the book and slip with a new date. Wow! It was like I <em>owned</em> the book.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know how many times I renewed that book. I&#8217;m afraid I don&#8217;t remember the words any more. But I still remember the pleasure that it gave me.</p>\n<h4>Galadriel the Fair</h4>\n<p>On the last day of junior school our form teacher, Miss Rees, wrote a long list of books on the board and asked us to copy the list into the back of our exercise books. She said that these were books we should try and read. I don&#8217;t have the exercise book any more and I remember very little of the list. I do remember that I&#8217;d already read some of them. And I remember <cite>The Hobbit</cite> and <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=intitle:%22The+Lord+of+the+Rings%22\">The Lord of the Rings</a>. Oh boy, do I remember <cite>The Hobbit</cite> and <cite>The Lord of the Rings</cite>.</p>\n<p>Terry Pratchett said that if you&#8217;re a 14 year old boy and you don&#8217;t think that The Lord of the Rings is the best book ever written then there may be something wrong with you, but if you&#8217;re 28 and you <em>still</em> think it&#8217;s the best book ever written then there&#8217;s <em>definitely</em> something wrong with you. I <em>was</em> that 14 year old boy. I stayed up all night reading it. I fell asleep reading it. I read the appendices. I worked out how to write my name in Elvish script. I even read <cite>The Silmarillion</cite> and thought I enjoyed it. I can still recite some of the poetry. In Elvish. I&#8217;ve forgotten the words of Cannonball Simp, but get me going with &#8220;A Elbereth Gilthoniel&#8230;&#8221; and I can just about reel off the rest of the poem. What&#8217;s wrong with me?</p>\n<p>By the time I was 28, LotR wasn&#8217;t the best book ever written. I&#8217;m no longer sure that there is such a thing as &#8220;The Best Book Ever Written&#8221;. Still, if you haven&#8217;t at least read <cite>The Hobbit</cite> you should take steps to rectify matters. Or wait for the Peter Jackson movie.</p>\n<h4>The Daughter of a Pirate King</h4>\n<p>Confession time: I haven&#8217;t read <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=intitle:%22Pippi+Longstocking%22\">Pippi Longstocking</a>. The &#8216;I&#8217; of <cite>A Child of the Library</cite> is a composite of Gill and me. <cite>Pippi Longstocking</cite> was her Nancy Blackett. The  <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=Bastable+inauthor:Nesbit\">Bastables</a> were her Pevensies.</p>\n<h4>Paddington the Bear</h4>\n<p>Once I&#8217;d learned that reading for myself was pure pleasure, I read anything and everything I could find in the library and I discovered Michael Bond&#8217;s <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=intitle:Paddington+inauthor:%22Michael+Bond%22\">Paddington Bear</a>. Paddington was a well meaning young bear from Peru who was found, wearing a duffel coat and a label reading &#8220;Please look after this bear&#8221;, at Paddington Station by the Brown Family. The Browns took him in immediately, named him Paddington after the station and&#8230; &#8216;hijinks ensue&#8217;.</p>\n<p>I would be quietly reading these books to myself when some episode or another (&#8220;Baked Elastic&#8221;; the Russian ballet dancer; the wobbly table&#8230;) would cause me to laugh out loud and my brother would demand to know what was funny and made me read whatever it was aloud to him. I have to confess, I resented this, but not enough to dent my enjoyment. The Paddington books are made of joy.</p>"

40cbdc72-fa5b-9d1e-6aa4-4131049e0374.description	"<p>Or… what I did this summer.</p>\n<p>Summer as been frantic. Mostly joyous, but frantic.</p>\n<p>I had talks accepted at both <a href=\"http://www.yapc2011.us/yn2011/\"><span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span></a> and <a href=\"http://oscon.com/\"><span class=\"caps\">OSCON</span></a>. Because <span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span> was in Asheville, and the <a href=\"http://www.swangathering.com/\">Swannanoa Gathering</a> Traditional Song Week fell the week after <span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span>, that meant I flew out to Asheville for an intense fortnight of Perl community engagement followed by a week spent singing myself hoarse and being blown away by <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/sheilakayadams\">Sheila Kay Adams&#8217;s</a> singing and her stories of mountain life and listening to future stars like <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/sheilakayadams\">Sam Gleaves</a> and inspiring activists like <a href=\"http://www.blairpathways.com/\">Saro Lynch Thomason</a>. I could write entire posts on every one of those, and that&#8217;s before I get on to the magic of watching the sun go down and the fireflies come up from the grass of the Warren Wilson College&#8217;s natural amphitheatre. Magical so it was.</p>\n<p>On the last night of the gathering, there was a student showcase. Of course, I sang <a href=\"http://www.bofh.org.uk/child-of-the-library\">Child of the Library</a>. Rather embarrassingly, I skipped a verse, but the response was great. Several people came up to me afterwards and told me their library stories and, I hope, went home with a determination to help protect their libraries.</p>\n<p>Then it was back to the UK for a fortnight before heading off again to <span class=\"caps\">OSCON</span> in Portland, OR. I was down to give two talks, one on <a href=\"http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011/public/schedule/detail/17872\">Higher Order Javascript</a> and a second on <a href=\"http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011/public/schedule/detail/18577\">Polymorphic Dispatch</a> which proved to be a bear to write. I&#8217;d planned to have everything done and dusted and the slides learned by the time I flew out, but spent a huge amount of time blocked on how I was going to present the ideas using a motivating problem that hit the sweet spot between too simple and too complicated. It wasn&#8217;t until I arrived in Portland and talked things through with my host, <a href=\"http://www.justatheory.com/\">David Wheeler</a>, that I got that worked out. The slides were written in a tearing rush and weren&#8217;t as good as I would like them to be. I still owe the talk attendees a full writeup, so I&#8217;ll take this opportunity to apologise for the lateness and promise that a writeup <em>will</em> arrive. The Javascript talk was based on one I&#8217;ve given before, but I&#8217;m starting to realise that it&#8217;s a full tutorial masquerading as a short talk. More on that later, I hope.</p>\n<p>What with flapping about the unwritten talk, and the 10 minute gap between them, I didn&#8217;t really worry overmuch about the Perl lightning talks. It&#8217;s been my practice to sing a lightly massaged version of <a href=\"http://LOUANDPETER.COM/\">Lou and Peter Berryman&#8217;s</a> very splendid song <cite>A Chat With Your Mother</cite> with tailored verses about different language communities and various Perl luminaries. I <em>had</em> decided to retire it, but at <span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span> I came up with a snide verse about myself and another about Larry Wall, so it felt renewed enough to be worth singing this year as well. I ended up singing Child of the Library again.</p>\n<p>The response was phenomenal. I&#8217;ve been singing it for long enough now that I know it <em>gets</em> people. Hell, when I was writing it, there were verses that were hard to sing because they got me and I was choking up as I tried to sing them. But the lightning talk got a standing ovation. Again people were telling me library stories and I found that the UK isn&#8217;t the only country with local governments stupid enough to consider closing libraries, it was happening in the US too. So, fired up by that response, I went to see Sarah Novotny and begged her for five minutes on the <span class=\"caps\">OSCON</span> stage before the closing keynote. Bless her, she let me have it.</p>\n<h3>Pics, or it didn&#8217;t happen!</h3>\n<p>I have proof too! The main stage at O&#8217;Reilly events has serious video equipment pointed at it. Because it&#8217;s important that people get to see serious talks about <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnX5v0uwNjc&amp;list=PL93FC98105B19725C&amp;index=39&amp;feature=plpp\">known bugs and exploits in wetware</a>. Because my performance wasn&#8217;t on the schedule, and I didn&#8217;t have a video release all signed and ready to go beforehand, it&#8217;s taken a while to get the video available. But last night, that changed, so here I am, in all my corpulent glory. Enjoy. And please, spread this video as far and as wide as you can. Libraries are important.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"345\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/MDi5JtS1H-g\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>"

This happens as I sing  it out to different audiences and find out which bits work, which bits are hard to sing and all the other little details that you only find out when there&#8217;s a living, breathing, listening and (hopefully) singing audience in front of you.</p>\n<p>It turns out that the same things happens with songs I&#8217;ve written.</p>\n<p>The biggest stumbling block of the original version is the last line of the first verse:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My wife met Pippi Langstumpf, I met Paddington the Bear</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Someone on the comment thread suggested:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Heidi, Pippi Longstocking and Paddington the Bear</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which is fine, except that means singing &#8216;PIPpi LONGstockING&#8217;, and I&#8217;m not happy with putting the emphasis on the <span class=\"caps\">WRONG</span> sylLABles if I can possibly help it. In the revised version, I think I&#8217;ve cracked it. The line is now:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The daughter of a pirate king and Paddington the bear</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which is <em>much</em> easier to sing and follows the rest of the verse by being a more oblique reference to the character. If you know who Pippi is, then it&#8217;s obvious who I&#8217;m singing about. If you don&#8217;t, then maybe I&#8217;ve piqued your curiosity.</p>\n<p>The first recording also had two slightly different tunes for the verses, this version has settled on just the one.</p>\n<p>And, for people who care about that sort of thing, this was recorded with a click track at 110bpm rather than speeding up over the course of the song, which should make life a little easier for anyone taking part in Rabid Gravy&#8217;s <a href=\"http://blog.rabidgravy.com/making-music-to-save-our-libraries\">project</a> to remix and rerecord different versions of the song.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re concerned about Library closures, a good place to start is <a href=\"http://www.voicesforthelibrary.org.uk/\">Voices for the Library</a>. If you&#8217;re on twitter, you might also start following <a href=\"http://twitter.com/ukpling\">@ukpling</a>. If you&#8217;re not concerned about library closures, why on earth did you read this far, and what kind of excuse for a human being are you?</p>"

Frankly, instrumentation scares me, I&#8217;m much happier singing unaccompanied but I realise I&#8217;m in a minority on this.</p>\n<p>When you sing it, try making the song your own by changing things to suit your own. Julie Chilton&#8217;s posted an alternate first verse in the comments, but the world is the mollusc of your choice.</p>\n<p>The &#8216;I&#8217; in the song, isn&#8217;t <em>quite</em> me and it isn&#8217;t quite Gill either. Most importantly, both of us grew up in houses where no book was out of bounds. Our fathers used to take us to our respective local libraries (Lewisham for Gill, Doncaster Central and then Bawtry for me) every week or so on a Saturday morning. As soon as I was old enough, I&#8217;d ride my bike from our home in Scrooby to Bawtry with a carrier full of books hanging off the handlebars. Bawtry is currently in the crosshairs of Doncaster&#8217;s idiot mayor &#8211; the bloke who suggested getting kindles for everyone instead &#8211; along with 13 other libraries in the district.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a revised version of the recording with additional notes at: http://www.bofh.org.uk/2011/04/04/a-child-of-the-library-revised, or just press play:</p>\n<p><object height=\"81\" width=\"100%\"> <param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F13031396\"></param> <param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param> <embed allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"81\" src=\"http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F13031396\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed> </object>  <span><a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/pdcawley/child-of-the-library-revised\">Child Of The Library (Revised)</a> by <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/pdcawley\">pdcawley</a></span></p>\n<h5>August 9th 2011</h5>\n<p>I&#8217;ve updated the lyrics here to reflect what I sing now.

Somehow there are companies out there selling very high end, and \"provably secure\" cryptography gear, all based on fundamental principles of quantum mechanics. Yet, despite being <em>fundamentally</em> unbreakable, there have been quite a few publications on more-or-less practical ways for Eve to eavesdrop on people whispering quantum sweet-nothings in darkened rooms.</p>\n<p>As a bemused onlooker, I jumped on the TGV train from Paris to journey to the heart of quantum key distribution (QKD): Geneva. Geneva is where QKD was deployed in real-world demonstrations, it is the base of Id Quantique, a company that specializes in quantum physics based security products, and it is home to University of Geneva's <em>GAP-Optique</em>, a power house of quantum optics research.</p>\n<p>My goal was to discover what all the fuss was about. Who buys a QKD distribution system? Why do they bother? If QKD becomes ubiquitous, where is the battle between white and black hats going to be played out, and how will that battle change? What is the future of QKD research?</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/09/quantum-cryptography-yesterday-today-and-tomorrow/\">Read 91 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/09/quantum-cryptography-yesterday-today-and-tomorrow/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/Hm8Da6yqCUUNpqUDpkmfk6_Vgi8/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/Hm8Da6yqCUUNpqUDpkmfk6_Vgi8/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/Hm8Da6yqCUUNpqUDpkmfk6_Vgi8/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/Hm8Da6yqCUUNpqUDpkmfk6_Vgi8/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/Ls5uZSncw6U\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

Originally started as a small gathering of Dungeons &amp; Dragons co-creator Gary Gygax’s friends, GenCon now finds itself the capstone event amidst a kind of golden age for so-called hobby games. Board gamers, role-playing gamers, LARPers, and war gamers all sit shoulder to shoulder in its massive play spaces, while buskers vie for their attention on the nearly 400-strong vendor floor. Boosted by satellite events like PAX and the un-closeting of an emboldened gamer population at large, there’s plenty of room for continued growth.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">Buried inside the sacred tome that is GenCon’s annual program, amidst the thousands of play sessions of new and old properties, was a listing for an entirely new event—a keynote presentation. To no one’s surprise, the keynote presentation was given by Wizards of the Coast (WotC). Their goal? To rally the faithful around their grand experiment called \"D&amp;D Next.\"</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">The time of troubles</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">The Dungeons &amp; Dragons family of games has been in and out of a state of civil war throughout its history. Call them “The Edition Wars.” OD&amp;D begat AD&amp;D which begat Third Edition, and with each transition came, if not enmity within the ranks, then perhaps the kind of gentle chiding that siblings have for one another across the dinner table. But nothing ruined Thanksgiving quite like the row that developed over the release of Dungeons &amp; Dragons Fourth Edition, colloquially known as D&amp;D 4e.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/09/getting-back-to-the-story-hands-on-with-dungeons-dragons-next/\">Read 27 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/09/getting-back-to-the-story-hands-on-with-dungeons-dragons-next/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/IjyOG5Vw2xSncJG_esEnIyBuOFI/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/IjyOG5Vw2xSncJG_esEnIyBuOFI/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/IjyOG5Vw2xSncJG_esEnIyBuOFI/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/IjyOG5Vw2xSncJG_esEnIyBuOFI/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/Iia7rbYaslk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

This seems easy at first. When the game begins, you invariably find yourself on a sandy beach somewhere, and a bit of experimentation quickly yields the knowledge that you can affect your environment by punching things. You can punch trees to break them apart and collect wood, for instance, which you can use to make tools, which you can use to gather more materials, which you can use to make more things. You'll just be getting the hang of the basic mechanics when night falls—and the zombies and skeletons and spiders and creepers come out to collect your soul.</p>\n<p>As the game grew more popular, Persson (known to fans by his in-game handle \"Notch\") hired staff and eventually turned over daily programming duties to other folks. These days, Notch spends his days developing other games and being <a href=\"http://penny-arcade.com/report/editorial-article/notch-interview\">interviewed</a> by famous Internet journalists, while <em>Minecraft</em> thrives on multiple platforms including PC, Mac, Linux, and XBox 360.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/09/blocks-with-friends-how-to-run-your-own-minecraft-server/\">Read 65 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/09/blocks-with-friends-how-to-run-your-own-minecraft-server/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/gF8kfzrsazCB0-hzE8UhHqMiCEY/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/gF8kfzrsazCB0-hzE8UhHqMiCEY/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/gF8kfzrsazCB0-hzE8UhHqMiCEY/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/gF8kfzrsazCB0-hzE8UhHqMiCEY/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/9tqTYR55SPM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

For every characteristic that we associate with a particular sex, the animal kingdom harbors at least one surprising exception; concepts that we believe are inextricably linked are uncoupled, and even reversed, in other species.</p>\n<p>Our sex exerts an incredible influence on our lives, influencing anatomy, appearance, behavior, and countless other traits.

Available both as part of Server 2012 and as a free (as in beer) standalone installation, the third generation of Hyper-V brings with it a collection of features that largely commoditize the sorts of things you’ve gotten used to having to pay extra for. There are even a few features you couldn’t do <em>at all</em> with other hypervisors (like live migration of a server from one server to another with no shared storage between the two).</p>\n<p>Hyper-V supports a host of high-availability and “resiliency” features, such as off-site replication of servers. And it does many of those things as well or better than offerings from VMware and Citrix—regardless of whether you’re virtualizing Windows servers, Windows desktops, or Linux. And then there’s the free part: while the licenses for Windows Server itself are tied to a specific set of hardware, other operating systems can be hosted on the standalone Hyper-V server and managed as part of the same environment. All with the same sort of manageability.</p>\n<p>In this first look at Hyper-V 2012, we look at some of the high points of the hypervisor and its management environment from the perspective of a small to mid-sized enterprise. While many of the new features have been available on other virtualization platforms for some time, Hyper-V matters largely because of the way that Microsoft has tied them all up in a relatively simple and inexpensive package. This could potentially save organizations a significant amount of money—while preserving their sanity as well.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/09/first-look-hyper-v-2012-targets-vmwares-air-supply/\">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/09/first-look-hyper-v-2012-targets-vmwares-air-supply/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/qGk5X-tfvdXUa6UX_AQ5sUk8DJc/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/qGk5X-tfvdXUa6UX_AQ5sUk8DJc/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/qGk5X-tfvdXUa6UX_AQ5sUk8DJc/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/qGk5X-tfvdXUa6UX_AQ5sUk8DJc/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/FixehGsitwM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

Behind Door Number One sits a free-to-watch service that uses off-the-shelf technology and that buffers just enough of each show to put the live stream on the Internet.

That technology, supplied by a subsidiary of the French IT firm Bull, used a technique called deep packet inspection (DPI) to capture e-mails, chat messages, and Web visits of Libyan citizens.</p>\n<p>The fact that the Qaddafi regime was using deep packet inspection technology wasn’t surprising. Many governments have invested heavily in packet inspection and related technologies, which allow them to build a picture of what passes through their networks and what comes in from beyond their borders. The tools secure networks from attack—and help keep tabs on citizens.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.narus.com/\">Narus</a>, a subsidiary of Boeing, supplies “cyber analytics” to a customer base largely made up of government agencies and network carriers. Neil Harrington, the company’s director of product management for cyber analytics, said that his company’s “enterprise” customers—agencies of the US government and large telecommunications companies—are ”more interested in what's going on inside their networks” for security reasons. But some of Narus’ other customers, like Middle Eastern governments that own their nations’ connections to the global Internet or control the companies that provide them, “are more interested in what people are doing on Facebook and Twitter.”</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/08/big-brother-meets-big-data-the-next-wave-in-net-surveillance-tech/\">Read 63 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/08/big-brother-meets-big-data-the-next-wave-in-net-surveillance-tech/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/C0feMutPRInXFsJpDul1xmeaaoU/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/C0feMutPRInXFsJpDul1xmeaaoU/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/C0feMutPRInXFsJpDul1xmeaaoU/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/C0feMutPRInXFsJpDul1xmeaaoU/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/3w0FQVI8TU8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

Since the first models hit the market, the Ultrabook moniker—originally created to denote a thin, light laptop using a low-voltage Intel processor and a fast solid-state drive—has come to encompass just about any laptop that is thinner or lighter than usual.</p>\n<p>Acer's Aspire Timeline M5-481TG is one such computer. Acer officially refers to it as an Ultrabook, but its 14\" screen and 4.3 pound weight definitely push the limits of the term. That said, the M5 uses the extra size and weight to its advantage, packing a dedicated graphics processor and a DVD burner into a relatively thin-and-light frame. It's not the fastest gaming notebook on the market, and it's definitely not the thinnest and lightest. But can this laptop's specs make it a solid all-rounder, or does the approach simply produce a chunky, compromised Ultrabook?</p>\n<table class=\"specifications center\" width=\"500\">\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\" colspan=\"2\">Specs at a glance: Acer Aspire Timeline Ultra M5-481TG</th>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<th>Screen</th>\n<td>1366x768 at 14\" (112 ppi)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<th>OS</th>\n<td>Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<th>CPU</th>\n<td>1.7GHz Intel Core i5-3317U (Turbo boost up to 2.6GHz)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<th>RAM</th>\n<td>4GB 1333MHz DDR3 (officially supports up to 6GB, reports say it can support 10GB)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<th>GPU</th>\n<td>1GB NVIDIA GeForce GT 640M LE and Intel HD Graphics 4000 (switchable)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<th>HDD</th>\n<td>2.5” 5400RPM 500GB hard drive, 20GB SSD</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<th>Networking</th>\n<td>Gigabit Ethernet, dual-band 802.11n, Bluetooth 4.0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<th>Ports</th>\n<td>2x USB 3.0, HDMI, card reader, headphones</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<th>Size</th>\n<td>13.4\" x 0.8\" x 9.6\"</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<th>Weight</th>\n<td>4.30 lbs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<th>Battery</th>\n<td>3-cell 4850 mAh Li-ion</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<th>Price as reviewed</th>\n<td><a href=\"http://us.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/model/NX.M27AA.001\">$779.99</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<th>Other perks</th>\n<td>Webcam, backlit keyboard, DVD burner, 1 year warranty</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Design and build quality</h2>\n<p>The M5 is constructed entirely from plastic—the lid, display bezel, and top case are all dark gray and have a faux-brushed metal look, while the bottom of the laptop is a black, textured matte plastic. There's a bit of flexing in the top case, especially in the lid, but the laptop has a nice dense feel to it and doesn't feel overly cheap in spite of its construction. The M5 is of a uniform, 0.8\" thickness throughout, with none of the tapering seen in many Ultrabooks, and the laptop's lid sits flush with its slightly raised LCD hinge when closed. The hinge itself feels sturdy, but not so stiff that you can't open the laptop without holding the bottom down.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/trying-to-have-it-all-acers-timeline-m5-gaming-ultrabook/\">Read 35 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/trying-to-have-it-all-acers-timeline-m5-gaming-ultrabook/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/QBnChJFy55yrEvKPOY-GQ89y3g8/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/QBnChJFy55yrEvKPOY-GQ89y3g8/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/QBnChJFy55yrEvKPOY-GQ89y3g8/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/QBnChJFy55yrEvKPOY-GQ89y3g8/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/o0lGdZeWgcg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

Well, \"watching\" per se. You're actually staring into the ever-present glow of your smartphone ready to read an urgent memo from your boss; hoping to next check live stats because you're <em>so close</em> to finally winning a fantasy football game.</p>\n<p>Then, tragedy strikes—your phone is showing five bars, but it's slowed to a crawl. You check the available WiFi networks: \"Free Stadium WiFi.\" You select, but deep in your heart you know there's no chance of connecting up here, 100 feet below the cloud cover. And that's when you come to a horrific realization: I'm going to have to put my phone in my pocket and <em>actually</em> pay attention.</p>\n<p>It's a “scary” thought for sports fans: Someday soon, the wireless network at your favorite team’s stadium could be so congested you’ll actually be forced to—gasp!—watch the game you paid a ticket for. People like Katee Panter, VP of infrastructure technology at Madison Square Garden in New York, fear growing use of smartphones and tablets to surf the Web or stream video will make it difficult to provide cellular and WiFi connections for everyone. Teams are taking advantage of fans' handheld devices by building apps to serve up interactive experiences or provide an easier way to order food and beverages. But delivering wireless Internet connections to tens of thousands of densely packed people is no easy technological feat.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/features/2012/08/why-your-smart-device-cant-get-wifi-in-the-home-teams-stadium/\">Read 27 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/features/2012/08/why-your-smart-device-cant-get-wifi-in-the-home-teams-stadium/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/t_liO1P8J2caH3JyrMGeIDQQnk0/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/t_liO1P8J2caH3JyrMGeIDQQnk0/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/t_liO1P8J2caH3JyrMGeIDQQnk0/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/t_liO1P8J2caH3JyrMGeIDQQnk0/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/KIAxQJTRi7o\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

0815ec1c-a6bd-3cee-ed73-b1a9e694057b.description	"<p>We had such hopes for Intel's Ultrabook movement. With the first clarion call, we <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2011/09/ultrabook-intels-300-million-plan-to-beat-apple-at-its-own-game/\">dreamed of a PC</a> that would shatter Apple's monopoly on high-quality ultra-thin-and-light notebooks. In the first year of the Ultrabook campaign, we saw a few possible claimants to the throne, but in general, each entry was more disappointing than the last. The machines became notorious for using workarounds like larger screens (a 14-inch monitor in a 13-inch body!) and hard disk drives with flash caches (rather than actual solid-state drives) to skirt Intel's Ultrabook speed and size requirements.</p>\n<p>Nearly a year after Intel launched the initiative, manufacturers have finally taken the Ultrabook specs to heart. Lenovo's ThinkPad X1 Carbon reflects what we feel is the <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/01/ultra-in-name-only-the-failures-of-intels-ultrabook-rules/\">true spirit of an Ultrabook</a>: a light, thin body with powerful internals. Lenovo gets it. At long last, PCs have a real shot at the segment Apple has been dominating for years with the MacBook Air.</p>\n<div class=\"image center full-width\" style=\"width:640px\"><img src=\"http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/thinkpad_x1_carbon_keyboard.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"508\"></div>\n<h2>The touch, the feel of rubberized silicone</h2>\n<p>First, the waifish body: at a base 2.99 pounds, 0.31 inches at its thinnest point, and 0.74 inches at its thickest, the X1 Carbon has similar dimensions to the MacBook Air (2.96 pounds and 0.68 inches at its thickest). But that's the 13-inch MacBook Air; the X1 Carbon actually has a 14-inch 1600×900 screen packed into a \"13-inch body,\" as hardware manufacturers are recently so fond of saying. The extra display area is noticeable compared to a 13-inch computer, yet our backs and shoulders don't suffer any more for the extra real estate. And when we say 13-inch body, we mean it; the X1 Carbon is 13.03 inches wide by 8.9 inches deep, comparing well with the MacBook Air at 12.8 by 8.94 inches.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/a-worthy-ultrabook-appears-the-thinkpad-x1-carbon-reviewed/\">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/a-worthy-ultrabook-appears-the-thinkpad-x1-carbon-reviewed/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/EKJppYCqOw0fihWnleJoA8zArOg/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/EKJppYCqOw0fihWnleJoA8zArOg/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/EKJppYCqOw0fihWnleJoA8zArOg/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/EKJppYCqOw0fihWnleJoA8zArOg/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/yu-uBCAu2t8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

To give you some guidance in this back-to-school season, we've set up three basic laptop categories. <strong>Basic laptops</strong> emphasize price over performance or size; <strong>gaming laptops</strong> emphasize performance over price or size; and <strong>lightweight laptops</strong> emphasize size over price or performance. Each is further subdivided into price ranges.</p>\n<p>Every category features picks that, in our view, represent some of the best machines available now. In most cases, we've also included a few alternatives in case something about our main pick was a dealbreaker for you.

But the prosecutors sitting across the courtroom from him didn't work for the Crown—they were lawyers for the movie studio trade group Federation Against Copyright Theft (FACT).</p>\n<p>FACT, not public officials in the UK, was the driving force behind Vickerman's prosecution. Indeed, FACT effectively took on the role of a private law enforcement agency. Private investigators hired by FACT first identified Vickerman as the administrator of STC and built the case against him. His assets were frozen at FACT's request by a government agency—which was itself funded by FACT. And when the UK's public prosecutors decided not to press charges against Vickerman at all, FACT initiated a criminal prosecution on its own dime.</p>\n<p>This is a new development for anti-piracy efforts. Organizations like the MPAA, RIAA, IFPA, and FACT have long lobbied law enforcement officials to prosecute \"rogue sites\" and have provided them with information and logistical support to do so. But public prosecutors generally have the final say on who will be indicted. In the Vickerman case, the public prosecutors concluded that there wasn't enough evidence to merit prosecution. FACT disagreed and invoked what one lawyer told us is an \"archaic right\" for a private organization to bring criminal prosecutions against other private parties.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/08/private-justice-how-hollywood-money-put-a-brit-behind-bars/\">Read 44 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/08/private-justice-how-hollywood-money-put-a-brit-behind-bars/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/dLRxJ5Go-chXQxIhSNJvsqH5wZY/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/dLRxJ5Go-chXQxIhSNJvsqH5wZY/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/dLRxJ5Go-chXQxIhSNJvsqH5wZY/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/dLRxJ5Go-chXQxIhSNJvsqH5wZY/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/LKpXpY0nyuA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

With the rise of whole new classes of \"personal computers\"—tablets and smartphones—it's worth updating all the numbers once more. And when we do so, we see something surprising: the adoption rates for our beloved mobile devices absolutely blow away the last few decades of desktop computer growth. People are adopting new technology faster than ever before.</p>\n<p>Humans are naturally competitive creatures. Not only do we compete with each other for money and power, but we form strong allegiances to various tribes. Whether it's a favorite sports team or a chosen computing platform, we passionately cheer when they win and feel a punch in our guts when they lose. Companies know this, and they will trumpet their successes and quietly hide their failures. But is it any more important to want one multi-billion dollar company to win over another than it is to root for one arbitrary multi-million dollar athlete? Is it anything more than cheerleading?</p>\n\n<p>Well—there's certainly plenty of cheerleading, but tracking the rise of fall of market share over time has more serious uses, too. Software developers need to keep track of market share so they can decide where to invest their resources. Consumers may then choose platforms based on software availability. Platforms can live—and sometimes die—by market share. The successes and failures of one generation of platforms affect the next, and ultimately this has an impact on everyone's digital lives.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/business/2012/08/from-altair-to-ipad-35-years-of-personal-computer-market-share/\">Read 50 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/business/2012/08/from-altair-to-ipad-35-years-of-personal-computer-market-share/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/flSZkEK2_wLwv67uQ_nkbYUcorc/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/flSZkEK2_wLwv67uQ_nkbYUcorc/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/flSZkEK2_wLwv67uQ_nkbYUcorc/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/flSZkEK2_wLwv67uQ_nkbYUcorc/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/jYz2MMZLQqY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

It builds on the voice actions system that Google offered in previous versions of Android, adding support for natural language queries, but it also has a passive mode in which it will display contextually relevant information through Android’s notification system. Between the two approaches, Google Now can do all sorts of things.</p>\n<div class=\"image right\" style=\"width:300px\"><img src=\"http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/2012-07-14-17.53.371-300x533.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"533\"><div class=\"caption\"><div class=\"caption-text\">It knows the important stuff.</div> </div></div>\n<p>The voice control interface in Google Now operates much like Apple’s Siri; the software records and interprets the user’s voice, parsing full sentences of natural speech into commands. It responds by speaking back to the user and displaying relevant information. You can use the speech interface to dictate an e-mail or text message, search Google, perform a calculation or unit conversion, get the definition of a word, get a stock quote, search the platform’s built-in addressbook, set an alarm, play a song, get travel directions, get the current weather conditions in a region, or launch an application. The range of supported commands and queries is comparable to Siri's.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/review-androids-google-now-can-teach-siri-a-few-tricks/\">Read 43 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/review-androids-google-now-can-teach-siri-a-few-tricks/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/wI2qe0RCBRrNx0yq0Nt41V6Eahc/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/wI2qe0RCBRrNx0yq0Nt41V6Eahc/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/wI2qe0RCBRrNx0yq0Nt41V6Eahc/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/wI2qe0RCBRrNx0yq0Nt41V6Eahc/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/nkwuBC0j31Y\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

Its absence was brutally disappointing; thankfully, Tim Cook broke his vow of secrecy to reassure us that a new Mac Pro will arrive in 2013. But for filmmakers compressing hours of 4K footage or school labs in need of new Maya machines, that’s a long time to wait—perhaps too long. Since I was also in the market for a machine to help out with my V-Ray renders, I decided that the time had come to evaluate my alternatives. The current Westmere-based Mac Pro line is definitely out of sync with what’s available elsewhere, and it is no longer competitive from a price-to-power standpoint.</p>\n<p>I have heard it said that Dell, HP, and Apple split the workstation market pretty much three ways; whether or not this is true, it did seem worth taking a look at how the other big boys’ hot-rods rolled. The HP Z820 and Dell Precision T5600 are both monstrous dual-socket Intel E5-2665 Xeons clocked at 2.4GHz and, if I had to guess, I’d say that they are much like what would have replaced the dual Westmere Xeon 2.66GHz Mac Pro <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/2010/10/tri-screen-cpu-monitor-ars-reviews-the-12-core-2010-mac-pro/\">that I reviewed in 2010</a>.</p>\n<p>Of course, you can still build your own workstation, but I’m writing this for an audience who needs top-tier support and doesn’t want to chase six different companies when something goes wrong. I have my own overclocked 3930K gaming rig dual-booting Linux and Windows, but as I’ve pointed out countless times in the comments section of my Mac Pro reviews, a workstation needs to do one thing: keep working. Vendor support remains key to making this happen.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/as-mac-pro-stagnates-pc-workstations-muscle-ahead/\">Read 93 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/as-mac-pro-stagnates-pc-workstations-muscle-ahead/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/fn_wIMbfc-7y7iitMeT2152bWG0/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/fn_wIMbfc-7y7iitMeT2152bWG0/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/fn_wIMbfc-7y7iitMeT2152bWG0/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/fn_wIMbfc-7y7iitMeT2152bWG0/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/Xuqtj50gGio\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

Venus is similar in size and mass to our planet, but its broiling hot surface temperature and sulfuric acid rain put some hard limits on comparisons; other interesting worlds lack atmospheres or are frozen over. But Mars has potential. Despite the thin carbon dioxide atmosphere and low surface gravity (if you weigh 150 pounds on Earth, you'd only weigh 56 pounds on Mars), the planet is just enough like Earth to offer the promise of habitability—whether in the future by humans, or in the past or present by native life forms.</p>\n<p>So it's no surprise that Mars was an exploration target from the very beginning of spaceflight. The first missions sent to Mars by the Soviet Union began in 1960, a scant three years after Sputnik. The first successful flyby came in 1965 with NASA's Mariner 4, and the first successful landing was the Soviet Mars 3 in 1971. That lander ceased transmission soon after touchdown, which is common on the Red Planet—Wikipedia's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration_of_Mars#Timeline\">timeline of Mars exploration</a> is a sobering read for that very reason.</p>\n<p>The many failures make the successful landings look even more amazing. With the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover, known as Curiosity, arriving on-planet August 6, we're going to take a look back at the landers and rovers that brought us to today.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/2012/08/mars-needs-rovers-and-its-getting-a-big-one/\">Read 26 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/2012/08/mars-needs-rovers-and-its-getting-a-big-one/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/7If4mo7pHL6NUwUJCl060HfIlag/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/7If4mo7pHL6NUwUJCl060HfIlag/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/7If4mo7pHL6NUwUJCl060HfIlag/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/7If4mo7pHL6NUwUJCl060HfIlag/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/RgP-rDJvKi0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

Founded by the former senior VP of Apple's iPod division, Tony Fadell, along with his partner Matt Rogers, Nest Labs set out to create what is essentially the iPod of the thermostat world. The round, user-friendly device was initially met with excellent reviews, but were these based in reality or were they the result of some Apple-like hype?</p>\n<p>I like to think of myself as somewhat of a thermostat nerd. (Listen, it doesn't sound very exciting because it's not, but I like them). I am fascinated by thermostats and their usability, but I also don't like to spend too much money on them—unless the extra cost is worth it. Friends and Twitter followers have long asked me to evaluate higher-end thermostats, and I'm always examining the thermostats at other people's houses. So when I finally had the opportunity to install a Nest, I jumped at it.</p>\n<p>Now that I've been using the Nest for several months, I have a pretty good feel for its strengths and weaknesses—at least compared to what is typically available on the market. Is the Nest really worth the $250 it costs to obtain one, just so you can have a fancier way of turning the temperature up and down? I think so—especially if you're the \"convenience oriented\" type (that's PC for \"lazy\").</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/a-thermostat-that-learns-three-months-with-the-nest/\">Read 44 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/a-thermostat-that-learns-three-months-with-the-nest/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/Jgvmmo8M68VUN6mGvaW8S6RYeLU/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/Jgvmmo8M68VUN6mGvaW8S6RYeLU/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/Jgvmmo8M68VUN6mGvaW8S6RYeLU/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/Jgvmmo8M68VUN6mGvaW8S6RYeLU/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/vdYSbKar1us\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

(I used that strategy to good effect when I worked on Parrot.\nCertainly Parrot could benefit from other performance improvements, but\nremoving low-hanging bottlenecks to maximum performance helped real programs in\nmeasurable ways.)</p>\n\n<p>Earlier this year, I profiled the <a\nhref=\"http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u64q/program.php?test=meteor&lang=perl&id=2\">benchmarks\ngame Perl meteor-contest entry</a>. I didn't expect to find any obvious\ncandidates for optimizing Perl 5, nor did I. I did find results that confirmed\nsome of my expectations.</p>\n\n<p>The program spends a lot of its time manipulating SVs. In fact, about 20% of\nthe runtime of the program goes to this. This is almost exclusively upgrading\nSVs. (An SV is the basic data type in Perl 5. It can store an integer value, a\nstring value, a numeric value, and more.)</p>\n\n<p>Here's the problem. The profile shows that this program performs almost\n65,000 array assignment operations (that's separate from a <code>push</code> or\na <code>splice</code>). This ends up in the guts of the Perl 5 function\n<code>Perl_pp_aassign</code> in <em>pp_hot.c</em>, which eventually gets to\nthis code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>\n        <span class=\"Identifier\">while</span> (<span class=\"Identifier\">relem</span> &lt;= <span class=\"Identifier\">lastrelem</span>) {    /* <span class=\"Identifier\">gobble</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">up</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">all</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">the</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">rest</span> */\n        <span class=\"Identifier\">SV</span> **<span class=\"Identifier\">didstore</span>;\n        <span class=\"Identifier\">assert</span>(*<span class=\"Identifier\">relem</span>);\n        <span class=\"Identifier\">sv</span> = <span class=\"Identifier\">newSV</span>(<span class=\"Constant\">0</span>);\n        <span class=\"Identifier\">sv_setsv</span>(<span class=\"Identifier\">sv</span>, *<span class=\"Identifier\">relem</span>);\n        *(<span class=\"Identifier\">relem</span>++) = <span class=\"Identifier\">sv</span>;\n        <span class=\"Identifier\">didstore</span> = <span class=\"Identifier\">av_store</span>(<span class=\"Identifier\">ary</span>,<span class=\"Identifier\">i</span>++,<span class=\"Identifier\">sv</span>);\n        <span class=\"Statement\">if</span> (<span class=\"Identifier\">magic</span>) {\n            <span class=\"Statement\">if</span> (<span class=\"Identifier\">SvSMAGICAL</span>(<span class=\"Identifier\">sv</span>))\n            <span class=\"Identifier\">mg_set</span>(<span class=\"Identifier\">sv</span>);\n            <span class=\"Statement\">if</span> (!<span class=\"Identifier\">didstore</span>)\n            <span class=\"Identifier\">sv_2mortal</span>(<span class=\"Identifier\">sv</span>);\n        }\n        <span class=\"Identifier\">TAINT_NOT</span>;\n        }</code></pre>\n\n<p>Essentially, for every element to assign to the array, create an entirely\nnew SV, copy in the contents of the old SV (remember, copy semantics!), and\nmove on. That copy operation ends up in <code>Perl_sv_setsv_flags()</code> in\n<em>sv.c</em> which goes through all sorts of gyrations to figure out what type\nof SV the destination should be.</p>\n\n<p>Hold on, didn't that SV already get created? Yes it did, but it's not the\nright type. It might not be big enough to hold the right data from the source.\nAfter some 400 lines of heavily macroed code, it does eventually get the right\ndata.</p>\n\n<p>This program profiles at 1.1 million SV copy operations. In almost 450,000\nof those, the source is <code>undef</code>, so nothing has to happen. In about\n580,000 of those, the source is a plain integer value.</p>\n\n<p>An integer is just data. It doesn't even need an SV if it's only ever\ntreated as an integer. It doesn't need copying, because it can happily remain\nan integer value.</p>\n\n<p>(Yes, if you're concerned that integer could ever overflow the 64 bits\nyou're probably using to store integers, you have to figure out a way to\nupgrade to some sort of arbitrary sided big integer, but that's very\ndoable.)</p>\n\n<p>It turns out that this program spends a lot of time bookkeeping polymorphic\ninternal data structures to store raw integers. That's not counting all of the\ntime spent manipulating the reference counts of raw integers or checking to see\nif you need to do anything special to get or store the value of and from a raw\ninteger.</p>\n\n<p>If it were possible to add type annotations to Perl 5 such that an integer\ncould only ever be an integer and never silently upgraded or an array could\nonly contain integers, it would be possible to update this program to get a\nsignificant amount of speed. A 10% improvement is within the realm of\npossibility, if not more. (I find the program a little too dense to skim and\nexplain at the same time I've been digging into the Perl 5 source code, so I\nwave my hands a little bit.)</p>\n\n<p>Sure, <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?PDL\">PDL</a> is great and I've\nused it effectively, and I'm fully capable of translating this code into XS\nwhere I <em>can</em> perform these manipulations in C where I <em>can</em>\nspecify their types, but crossing the barrier between Perl and PDL can be\ncostly unless you're very clever, and I don't want to write any more C than I\nhave to when Perl could make my job much more convenient.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, adding typed data structures to Perl 5 is a <em>huge</em>\namount of work. It would probably make the already complicated\n<code>Perl_sv_setsv_flags()</code> even more difficult to follow. It would\nrequire rewriting a lot of the internals. It probably depends on attaching\nthings like special behaviors to SV data structures instead of the bodies of\nPerl 5 operations, but that's also a good thing.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, using less memory and going faster is a good\nthing&mdash;and optional typing could open the door to further improvements\nsuch as type-directed optimizations and JITting.</p>\n\n<p>I know I said \"Perl 5 needs this feature in 2012\", but given the amount of work necessary to implement it, I have to back off a little bit to say that it would be nice to have. I hope you can see its value, and I hope it's possible to get it in a version of the Perl language sometime in the next couple of years.</p>"

I've explained <a href=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2012/09/why-perl-5-needs-a-metaobject-protocol.html\">Why Perl 5 Needs a Metaobject Protocol</a> and previously <a href=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2010/10/reinventing-the-axle.html\">Why Perl 5 Needs a Compiler-Free Extension Mechanism</a>.</p>\n\n<p>(If you don't follow the latter link, ask yourself this: would you use Perl\n5 on another VM if you didn't have access to the CPAN? As long as any CPAN\nstack you need includes an XS dependency, you're stuck with the C\nimplementation of Perl 5. Break that dependency and... you see where this is\ngoing.)</p>\n\n<p>If you read a good book on compilers such as <a\nhref=\"http://www.amazon.com/Structure-Interpretation-Computer-Programs-Engineering/dp/0262011530?tag=onyneopre-20\">SICP</a>\nor <a\nhref=\"http://www.amazon.com/Compilers-Principles-Techniques-Tools-2nd/dp/0321486811/?tag=onyneopre-20\">the\nDragon book</a> or even a good book on <a\nhref=\"http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Common-Lisp-Peter-Seibel/dp/1590592395/ref=sr_1_3?tag=onyneopre-20\">Lisp</a>,\nwhich is half of the same thing, you'll eventually run into the idea that you\ncan represent any program in a tree-like structure.</p>\n\n<p>That is to say, any type of computation you wish to perform can be\nrepresented with the right data structure, and that data structure happens to\nbe a tree. Even the venerable \"Hello, world!\" program from K&amp;R is a\ntree:</p>\n\n<pre><code>\nSTATEMENTS\n    / \\\nprint  exit\n  |      |\n\"Hello,  0\n world!\"</code></pre>\n\n<p>(You can represent this tree in a lot of ways, but you get the idea.) As\nSICP explains, the execution model governs how you traverse this tree.\nObviously in this tree, you start at the topmost node, then evaluate leftmost\ndepthfirst until you end.</p>\n\n<p>Even though your processor likely doesn't execute programs by traversing\ntrees and your language's favorite runtime doesn't either, tree structures are\nstill very useful in compilers because they're simple data structures that are\neasy to traverse and produce and manipulate.</p>\n\n<p>This is one reason that fans of Lisp think that Lisp is the ultimate\nprogramming language: you write it by writing this tree directly as source code\nand you can manipulate that tree with source code as if it were a tree, because\nit is.</p>\n\n<p>Many of the rest of us don't want to spend the rest of our lives writing\ntrees by hand, but sometimes we <em>do</em> want to do things with source code\nwithout having to write our own compilers, or at least our own parsers.</p>\n\n<p>Do you know know people say \"<a\nhref=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2009/08/on-parsing-perl-5.html\">Parsing\nPerl is Hard</a>?\" That's because it is. It's not <em>impossible</em>, but the\nPerl 5 parser is a complicated program that mixes up the traditional roles of\nlexing and parsing such that replicating that parse completely is difficult, at\nbest. This is why writing a syntax highlighter for Perl 5 is more difficult\nthan writing one for Lisp.</p>\n\n<p>Do you know how something like <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Devel::Declare\">Devel::Declare</a> works?\nI do, and I don't want to explain it to you. It's not particularly yucky magic,\nbut it's not particularly lovely magic either.</p>\n\n<p>Do you know how Perl 5's optimizer works? It's very limited.</p>\n\n<p>Do you know how Perl 5 source filters work? Not that well! That's why <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Switch\">the Switch module</a> was\ndeprecated in the commit after it became a core module.</p>\n\n<p>Do you know how <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/PPI\">PPI</a> works? Most of\nthe time, very well, but with lots of magic and a few very well understood edge\ncases and not a lot of speed.</p>\n\n<p>All of these problems have the same root cause: it's exceedingly difficult\nto manipulate a Perl 5 program as anything other than text, because the one\nthing that unambiguously understands that program won't share its\nunderstanding.</p>\n\n<p>(That's not <em>entirely</em> true; a few years ago, Larry added a\ncompile-time option to Perl 5 to produce an annotated tree from the\nparser/lexer/compiler, but no one's done much with it.)</p>\n\n<p>A traditional compiler parses a document into a tree structure, then\nmanipulates that tree into at least one and probably more trees and finally\nemits code in another language. It's very patriotic (from tree to shining\ntree). This pattern is no accident; it's the basis of many programs (<a\nhref=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2011/08/everything-is-a-compiler.html\">everything\nis a compiler</a>).</p>\n\n<p>This process is so well understood that patterns exist for treating this\nprocess as a pipeline of tree transformations. As long as you know what kind of\ntree you're going to get and what kind of tree you need to produce, you can add\nyour own transformation step. (If that sounds like <a\nhref=\"http://plackperl.org/\">Plack middleware</a>, there's no coincidence there\neither.)</p>\n\n<p>A formalized AST in Perl 5, representing an official separation between the\nlexing/parsing and execution phases of Perl 5, made available to any and all\nprograms would let people write better syntax highlighters, sure, but also\nbetter IDEs (finding function declarations and associating them with source\ncode would be easier) or debuggers (see again \"finding things) or optimizers (a\npipeline of tree transformations) or transliterations to other VMs or languages\n(still not entirely <em>easy</em> but much more <em>possible</em>) or\nserialization mechanisms (avoid parsing; dump an AST to the execution engine)\nor even little languages atop Perl with their own parsers which compile to the\nPerl 5 AST and run as if they had been Perl all along.</p>\n\n<p>Think about that last point for a moment.</p>\n\n<p>(Think about that last point in the context of syntax weirding mechanisms\nlike <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?MooseX::Declare\">MooseX::Declare</a>, or\nanything which uses string <code>eval</code>.)</p>\n\n<p>Are you sold yet?</p>\n\n<p>Here's the bad news: this is a lot of work. It needs expertise and it needs\nresearch and planning. It needs at least one champion, and it probably needs\nfunding. The first approach will probably fail. It will take longer than anyone\nwants. The only way it will happen is if someone stubborn appears and says\n\"I'll do that!\" or \"I'll fund that!\" and gets just enough support to keep going\npast the difficult parts.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine how amazing it will be, though.</p>"

a5d1844a-0ce6-1f97-956e-a97c45a63979.description	"<p>In <a href=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2012/09/features-perl-5-needs-in-2012.html\">Features Perl 5 Needs in 2012</a>, I suggested five mostly-not-syntax features that Perl 5 could use right now.</p>\n\n<p>The caveat to all of these features is that 1) someone must <em>code</em>\nthem and 2) someone must <em>maintain</em> them. While p5p has traditionally\ndone a lot with a little, remember that any suggestions or discussions will\nonly make it into a Perl 5 release if enough effort goes into implementation to\nmake them happen. If you want any of these features to happen, contact TPF\nabout donations or volunteer your time and skills to help (even if all you feel\ncomfortable doing is helping to refine the design of a feature, that's\nworthwhile).</p>\n\n<p>I promised to explain these features in more detail. First up is a\nmetaobject protocol for Perl 5. Stevan Little and Jesse Luehrs are working on\n<a href=\"https://github.com/stevan/p5-mop\">a proof of concept MOP for Perl\n5</a>, so this feature is well underway.</p>\n\n<p>If you're not familiar with a metaobject protocol, the book <a\nhref=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Metaobject-Protocol-Gregor-Kiczales/dp/0262610744?tag=onyneopre-20\">The\nArt of the Metaobject Protocol</a> explains everything in extensive detail.\n(It's also a pretty good book about Common Lisp, so if you're interested in a\nsemi-practical theoretical exploration of why computer sciencey things like the\nlambda calculus and well-designed extension mechanisms matter, this is a great\nbook about the design and implementation of a language.)</p>\n\n<p>If you don't want to read ~350 pages right now, the short definition of a\nMOP is <em>an API for interacting with your object system</em>. Classes (if\nyour MOP supports them) are objects. You can define a new class by making\nmethod calls. You can create objects by making method calls. You can define an\nentirely new <em>style</em> of class by creating your own new metaclass with\ndifferent behaviors. This is the reason <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Class::MOP\">Class::MOP</a> predated <a\nhref=\"http://moose.perl.org/\">Moose</a>.</p>\n\n<p>A good MOP provides a great theoretical foundation for a wonderful object\nsystem. Where many of us have defended Perl 5's object system as \"minimal but\neffective and flexible\", a good MOP in the core would let us get rid of\n<code>bless</code> in our code... and have more good features.</p>\n\n<h2>Performance Improvements</h2>\n\n<p>Moose can be slow to start, if you have lots of little classes, all on disk\nin their individual modules. Not only are you doing lots of IO to find and load\nthose classes, but you have to build up all of the classes you've defined in\nmemory through Moose's import mechanism (<code>has()</code> and\n<code>extends()</code> and <code>with()</code> are all function calls) which\ncreates and populates a metaclass behind the scenes.</p>\n\n<p>This happens every time you start your program.</p>\n\n<p>Every MooseX extension you load changes things.</p>\n\n<p>Though some of this happens in XS, where memory use can be smaller (less\nPerl data structure overhead) and speed can be faster (the same algorithm done\nin C instead of something written atop C), much of this happens at the Perl 5\nlevel.</p>\n\n<p>A great MOP could have its own custom data structures and code in the core\nto represent classes and methods and attributes, rather than Perl 5 hashes and\narrays. A great MOP could have its own ops to handle things like introspection\nand dispatch. A great MOP could have parser support to avoid the overhead of\ncalling Perl 5 functions (or crossing the XS boundary) to perform basic\nsetup.</p>\n\n<h2>Simplicity of Alternate Object Systems</h2>\n\n<p>Perl 5's default object system is very flexible for strange people like me\nwho've programmed in far too many languages (and implemented a few) who like\nvarious features of multiple languages and think \"Hey, I know, I'll implement\nthis in Perl 5.\" You bless a reference. You invoke a method. That's it.\nEverything else you can build yourself.</p>\n\n<p>The downside is that you have to figure out how to build it yourself.\nSometimes that means even diving into the source code of Perl 5 <em>itself</em>\nto see how things happen.</p>\n\n<p>A good MOP provides a foundation on which you can provide your own custom\nbehavior. As long as you hew to the protocol it defines, you can do anything\nyou want: make a custom metaclass that allows simple and protected shared\nmemory between workers, provide automatic auditing around specific methods,\nproxy transparently to remote resources, anything.</p>\n\n<p>Better yet...</p>\n\n<h2>Interoperability Between Different Object Systems</h2>\n\n<p>One of the projects I maintain uses Moose heavily. One of its dependencies\npulls in <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Moo\">Moo</a>. The authors of\nboth object systems have gone to great lengths to make sure that both work\ntogether.</p>\n\n<p>With a good MOP in place in the core, you have to go to great lengths\n<em>not to interoperate well with other object systems</em>. The default is\ninteroperability.</p>\n\n<p>(Try that in Perl 5 now, where some of the web programming or IO classes\nbless typeglobs. Oh, you expected a blessed hash? Too bad!)</p>\n\n<h2>Syntactic Improvements</h2>\n\n<p>As I alluded to earlier, a good MOP opens the door for declarative syntaxes\nfor defining classes, methods, and attributes. We might finally get a\n<code>class</code> keyword and a <code>method</code> keyword. This is very nice\nbecause it'll be faster, but also...</p>\n\n<h2>Tool Improvements</h2>\n\n<p>... language keywords the language itself knows make their way into syntax\nhighlighters and static analysis tools and reformatters and refactorers. It's\neasy to get a list of all of the methods in all of the classes in a file when\nit's unambiguous to pick out all of the names of classes in a file because you\n<em>know</em> they all have the <code>class</code> keyword in front of them,\nfor example.</p>\n\n<p>Compare that to today, where anything that looks like a coderef in a\nnamespace is potentially a method or potentially a function and the only way to\nknow is to invoke it, and why bother even trying?</p>\n\n<h2>Current Status</h2>\n\n<p>It's difficult to argue against putting a MOP in the core. Stevan and Jesse\nare working hard on it, but they could use more eyeballs on the tests and\ndesign and certainly more testing on various platforms. If you've been looking\nfor an excuse to contribute to Perl 5.18 or Perl 5.20, this is a great place to\nstart.</p>"

(I'm perhaps most thankful for\nthe thankless work that's gone into Unicode 6.2 compliance and core support for\nUnicode throughout.) <a\nhref=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2012/05/why-i-use-perl-reliability.html\">The\nyearly release cycle has made Perl 5 even more reliable</a>, and that seems\nlikely to continue.</p>\n\n<p>A couple of years ago, someone asked me for my top five list of improvements\nPerl 5 needed. I was right about a couple, wrong about a couple of others, and\nmissed one or two important ones. For those playing along at home, I missed:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A yearly release cycle</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?feature\">feature</a> pragma</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For all its faults, <em>feature</em> broke the logjam by which it was\nimpossible to add new syntax or backwards-incompatible features to Perl 5. The\nmechanism isn't perfect (especially its implementation), but it allows\nprogress, and for that I'm thankful.</p>\n\n<p>I can't predict what will be ready for Perl 5.18 next April or May, but I\ncan update my list to include features I'd like to see in an upcoming release.\nI'll go into more detail of each of these features in future installments.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>A <a href=\"https://github.com/stevan/p5-mop\">metaobject protocol</a> in the\ncore, to improve Perl 5's object system in a well-defined way</li>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2010/10/reinventing-the-axle.html\">A ctypes-like replacement for simple XS</a></li>\n\n<li>A formalized AST between the parser and the code generator, with the\nability to manipulate the AST and inject new subtrees in pure Perl 5</li>\n\n<li>Compact, native-type data structures</li>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2012/09/the-advantages-of-declarative-exporting.html\">Declarative replacements for procedural code</a></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>(For the CL fans in the audience, I <em>like</em> syntax, and I have a lot\nof trouble giving up CPAN's breadth and cross-platform goodness.)</p>\n\n<p>What's on your list?</p>"

9a97f853-0aa5-28ca-83af-8e9ece23f0a8.description	"<p>I haven't written an infinite loop bug in a while. I suppose I was due. (The Greek gods always punish hubris.)</p>\n\n<p>I have a database table full of users. Let's call that table\n<code>user</code>. A user has one or more roles (from the <code>role</code>)\ntable. A user can be an unverified user, a free user, a subscriber, or an\nadministrator. (Administrators obviously are also subscribers, but you get the\npoint.)</p>\n\n<p>I use <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?DBIx::Class\">DBIx::Class</a>\nfor the database access layer. My <code>User</code> result class has a couple\nof methods which let other model actions query whether the user can perform\nspecific operations. They're <a\nhref=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2011/05/decoupling-testability-and-synthetic-attributes.html\">synthetic\nattributes</a>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>has [<span class=\"Constant\">qw(</span><span class=\"Constant\"> is_admin is_subscriber </span><span class=\"Constant\">)</span>], <span class=\"Constant\">is</span> =&gt; <span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">ro</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span>, <span class=\"Constant\">lazy_build</span> =&gt; <span class=\"Constant\">1</span>;\n\n<span class=\"Statement\">sub </span><span class=\"Identifier\">_build_is_admin      </span>{ <span class=\"Statement\">shift</span>-&gt;find_role_by_name( <span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">admin</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span>      ) }\n<span class=\"Statement\">sub </span><span class=\"Identifier\">_build_is_subscriber </span>{ <span class=\"Statement\">shift</span>-&gt;find_role_by_name( <span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">subscriber</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span> ) }</code></pre>\n\n<p>Obviously the implementation of <code>find_role_by_name()</code> is\nsupremely important. Here's how I originally wrote the code (no sense blaming\nanyone else for this, because <em>I</em> wrote all of the access control code\nmyself.) See if you can catch the bug:</p>\n\n<pre><code><span class=\"Statement\">sub </span><span class=\"Identifier\">find_role_by_name</span>\n{\n    <span class=\"Statement\">my</span> (<span class=\"Identifier\">$self</span>, <span class=\"Identifier\">$name</span>) = <span class=\"Identifier\">@_</span>;\n\n    <span class=\"Statement\">while</span> (<span class=\"Statement\">my</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$role</span> = <span class=\"Identifier\">$self</span><span class=\"Identifier\">-&gt;user_roles-&gt;next</span>)\n    {\n        <span class=\"Statement\">return</span> <span class=\"Constant\">1</span> <span class=\"Statement\">if</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$role</span><span class=\"Identifier\">-&gt;role-&gt;name</span> <span class=\"Statement\">eq</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$name</span>;\n    }\n\n    <span class=\"Statement\">return</span> <span class=\"Constant\">0</span>;\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>As a hint, the <code>user_roles</code> method represents the relationship\nbetween the <code>user</code> table and the <code>role</code> table. That\nmethod returns a DBIC resultset which represents the entries in the table with\na foreign key to the <code>user</code> table.</p>\n\n<p>See the bug yet? It took me a while. The problem is that <em>every\ninvocation of the loop</em> fetches a new resultset. Every invocation of the\nloop fetches only the <em>first</em> result from that resultset.</p>\n\n<p>My tests (yeah, I wrote the tests too, before I wrote this code in fact,\njust like you're supposed to do) didn't catch that because the rest of the code\nonly ever checked for one user role, the administrator role, anywhere else.\nOnly when I added code for the subscriber role did the subscription tests\ntrigger this infinite loop. (Now how abhorred in my imagination is that most\nexcellent jest!)</p>\n\n<p>I wish I could say that I diagnosed the cause immediately. I didn't. I\nstared at the code for far too long, until I had the presence of mind to put a\ndebugging statement in the loop body to print the name of the role.  (Stat\nofficium pristina nomine.)</p>\n\n<p>Here's the corrected code, with a single expression hoisted into a scalar\nvariable where it may endure properly:</p>\n\n<pre><code><span class=\"Statement\">sub </span><span class=\"Identifier\">find_role_by_name</span>\n{\n    <span class=\"Statement\">my</span> (<span class=\"Identifier\">$self</span>, <span class=\"Identifier\">$name</span>) = <span class=\"Identifier\">@_</span>;\n    <span class=\"Statement\">my</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$user_roles_rs</span> = <span class=\"Identifier\">$self</span><span class=\"Identifier\">-&gt;user_roles</span>;\n\n    <span class=\"Statement\">while</span> (<span class=\"Statement\">my</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$role</span> = <span class=\"Identifier\">$user_roles_rs</span><span class=\"Identifier\">-&gt;next</span>)\n    {\n        <span class=\"Statement\">return</span> <span class=\"Constant\">1</span> <span class=\"Statement\">if</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$role</span><span class=\"Identifier\">-&gt;role-&gt;name</span> <span class=\"Statement\">eq</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$name</span>;\n    }\n\n    <span class=\"Statement\">return</span> <span class=\"Constant\">0</span>;\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>I will say this: expecting your test suite to pass in under 30 seconds makes this sort of thing much easier to catch. If I'd had to wait for a continuous integration server to get around to checking this commit, I wouldn't have fixed it as quickly as I did.</p>\n\n<p>Then again, it's easier to debug bugs you never write in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>Oh, and if you catch the literary allusion in the title, here's your prize:\ncongratulations! You might be overeducated. (If you caught the other three\nallusions, have you ever noticed how much Pynchon's <em>V</em> influenced\nStephenson's <em>Cryptonomicon</em>?)</p>"

As more customers and businesses leverage Web technologies,\r\n\tmitigating XSS and other Web application vulnerabilities has become increasingly\r\n\timportant.

38c31044-1597-13c3-c1c7-542a626e4bee.description	"<p>Today, we released a prototype implementation of the W3C <a href=\"http://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source-orientation.html\">DeviceOrientation Event Specification draft</a> on <a href=\"http://www.html5labs.com/\">HTML5Labs.com</a>. This specification defines new DOM events that provide information about the physical orientation and motion of a device. Such APIs will let Web developers easily deliver advanced Web user experiences leveraging modern devices' sensors.</p>\r\n<h2>How This Helps Developers</h2>\r\n<p>With the Device Orientation API, developers can explore new input mechanisms for games, new gestures for apps (such as “shake to clear the screen” or “tilt to zoom”) or even augmented reality experiences. The prototype’s installation includes a sample game to get you started in understanding the API.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\">\r\n<iframe style=\"border: 1px solid #999;

Internet Explorer\r\n\t10 Developer Preview added support for <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/WD-css3-3d-transforms-20090320/\">\r\n\t\tCSS 3D Transforms</a> and <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-animations/\">CSS Animations</a>.\r\n\tBy tapping the power of your GPU and running asynchronously from regular JavaScript,\r\n\tthese IE10 features provide a more performant and flexible alternative to traditional\r\n\tscript-based animations for Web content.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn previous blog posts, we covered <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2012/02/02/css3-3d-transforms-in-ie10.aspx\">\r\n\t\tCSS 3D Transforms</a> as well as <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/11/21/adding-personality-with-css3-transitions-and-animations.aspx\">\r\n\t\t\tCSS Animations and Transitions</a>. In this post, we introduce a more “unconventional”\r\n\tuse case for these technologies by describing the concept of “full-page animations”\r\n\tthat can be used during the navigation process to add fluidity and continuity to\r\n\tbrowsing. Our target is to achieve a seamless browsing experience in which content\r\n\tsmoothly appears into view when the user visits a page and transitions away when\r\n\the clicks on a link or performs a relevant action.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThese effects can be accomplished by transforming the HTML <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>\r\n\telement using CSS Animations. However, this use case presents some considerations\r\n\tthat we felt were worthy of discussion, such as the effect of layout and sizing\r\n\ton transforming <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>, as well as how to appropriately time\r\n\tpage navigations so that they mesh properly with our animations.</p>\r\n<p style=\"background-color: rgb(200, 223, 251); padding: 2px 8px 6px;\">\r\n\tThe code samples in this post use unprefixed CSS markup as supported by IE10 Release\r\n\tPreview; other browsers may require vendor prefixes for the CSS Animations and CSS\r\n\tTransforms properties used.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tTransforming a Page’s Entire Content</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCSS Transforms are defined on the stylistic properties of an HTML DOM Element. For\r\n\texample, the markup for rotating an element 45 degrees along its Z axis would look\r\n\tlike this:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n\t<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">#element</span> {</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">transform</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">rotateZ(45deg)</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>}</code></p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAttaching a transform to the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element of your HTML document\r\n\tworks exactly the same way. So performing in order to declaratively add the same\r\n\teffect to your document’s <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> you could do something like\r\n\tthis:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n\t<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">body</span> {</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">transform</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">rotateZ(45deg)</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>}</code></p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLet’s look at a before-and-after shot of a page when applying a transform to the\r\n\tbody element:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\">\r\n\t<img style=\"max-width: 95%;\" alt=\"Screen shot showing applying a rotateZ(45deg) transform to the body element of a document\"\r\n\t\tsrc=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/5556.fpauc_2D00_image1.jpg\" /><br />\r\n\tApplying a rotateZ(45deg) transform to the body element of a document.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor three dimensional transformations, the CSS Transforms specification defines\r\n\tthe <code>perspective</code> property that can be specified on the parent of the\r\n\telement that we transforming. When transforming the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element\r\n\tof your content, it has to be applied to the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element that\r\n\tresides above it in the DOM hierarchy. Doing so is straightforward:\r\n</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n\t<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">html</span> {</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">perspective</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">500px</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>}</code></p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCombining this with a <code>rotateY(45deg)</code> transform on the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>\r\n\telement yields the following result:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\">\r\n\t<img style=\"max-width: 95%;\" alt=\"Screen shot showing applying a rotateY(45deg) transform to &lt;body&gt; with perspective: 500px set on &lt;html&gt;\"\r\n\t\tsrc=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/1323.fpauc_2D00_image2.jpg\" /><br />\r\n\tApplying a rotate(45deg) transform to &lt;body&gt; with perspective: 500px set on\r\n\t&lt;html&gt;.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe can manipulate the <code>transform-origin</code> property on the body element\r\n\tfor interesting results. Let’s look at a couple of examples:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n\t<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">body</span> {</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">transform-origin</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t50%</span> <span style=\"color: Blue;\">100%</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">transform</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">rotateX(45deg)</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>}</code></p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe above markup sets a rotation along X for the body element while shifting the\r\n\torigin of rotations to the bottom of the element using <code>transform-origin</code>.\r\n\tEffectively this rotates the document’s contents “into” the screen like this:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\">\r\n\t<img style=\"max-width: 95%;\" alt=\"Screen shot showing applying transform: rotateX(45deg) and transform-origin:  50% 100% to &lt;body&gt;\" src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/2728.fpauc_2D00_image3.jpg\" /></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe can also manipulate the <code>perspective-origin</code> property on the root\r\n\telement of our document to achieve an off-axis projection effect. Changing the style\r\n\tfor <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> to:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n\t<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">html</span> {</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">perspective</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">500px</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">perspective-origin</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t90%</span> <span style=\"color: Blue;\">50%</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>}</code></p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOur page now looks like this:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\">\r\n\t<img style=\"max-width: 95%;\" alt=\"Screen shot showing applying perspective: 500px and perspective-origin: 90% 50% to the &lt;html&gt; element\r\n\" src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/6038.fpauc_2D00_image4.jpg\" /></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBy using CSS Transforms, we can easily manipulate the visual appearance of the entirety\r\n\tof our page’s content. Since the usual layout and sizing rules still apply, some\r\n\ttransforms on the body element (particularly ones that use percentage values or\r\n\trely on the <code>transform-origin</code> property) can result in different visual\r\n\teffects depending on the content of our page. Recall our previous <code>rotateX(45deg)</code>\r\n\texample with <code>transform-origin</code> set to <code>50% 100%</code>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBelow you can see the results before and after the transform is applied.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\">\r\n\t<img style=\"max-width: 95%;\" alt=\"Screen shot highlighting the difference in scroll bars before and after the application of a transform under perspective projection\" src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/3806.fpauc_2D00_image5.jpg\" /></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNotice how the content does not actually pivot on the bottom of the window but rather\r\n\tat some point outside of the viewport. This is expected behavior for CSS Transforms:\r\n\tthe <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> is laid out normally, then it is rotated along its\r\n\tbottom edge that is somewhere off screen. You will also notice that the actual foot\r\n\tprint of the content has expanded (take a look at the scroll bars in the “after”\r\n\tpicture) in order to accommodate the transformed content (the fact that we are using\r\n\tperspective projection makes this effect even more pronounced).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo how do we deal with arbitrarily sized content when applying transforms to our\r\n\tbody element? Custom tailoring all content in order to ensure that the size of the\r\n\tbody does not expand more than a certain amount may be unrealistic. Instead, we\r\n\tcan use a simple HTML/CSS pattern that allows us to fix the size of the body element\r\n\tto that of the browser window and append content inside a wrapper <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>.\r\n\tThe following markup achieves just that:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n\t<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">html</span>, <span style=\"color: Maroon;\">body</span>\r\n\t\t\t\t{</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">width</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">100%</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">height</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">100%</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">min-width</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">100%</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">max-width</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">100%</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">padding</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">0</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">margin</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">0</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">overflow</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">hidden</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>}</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 2em\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>&nbsp;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">#Wrapper</span> {</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">position</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">absolute</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">width</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">100%</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">height</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">100%</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">overflow</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">scroll</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>}</code></p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe illustration below shows what happens when a page is scrolled vertically and\r\n\twe apply a <code>rotateY(45deg)</code> transform to the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>\r\n\telement of our document directly (left) and using the wrapper pattern (right):</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\">\r\n\t<img style=\"max-width: 95%;\" alt=\"Screen shot showing what happens when a page is scrolled vertically and a rotateY(45deg) transform is applied to the &lt;body&gt; element under perspective projection, with and without a wrapper CSS/HTML pattern\" src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/3884.fpauc_2D00_image6.jpg\" /></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe direct application of the transform results in a skewed visual result due to\r\n\tthe off-axis projection (since we are no longer looking at the “center” of the body\r\n\telement). Using the wrapper pattern ensures that the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element’s\r\n\t<code>perspective-origin</code> property (<code>50% 50%</code> by default) will\r\n\talways be correctly centered with relation to the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element,\r\n\tgiving us a pleasant visual effect.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBy utilizing the above pattern and setting up CSS Transforms with percentage values\r\n\twhenever possible, we can affect our <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element in consistent\r\n\tways, regardless of the size of its contents.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tFrom Transforms to Animations</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHaving sorted out the intricacies of applying CSS Transforms to the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>\r\n\telement, CSS Animations are the next step.

The document will actually rotate from <b>outside</b>\r\n\tof the visible area of the browser window and into full view:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\">\r\n\t<img style=\"max-width: 95%;\" alt=\"Three screen shots in sequence showing the affect of applying the &quot;rotateInLeft&quot; animation\" src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/8508.fpauc_2D00_image7.jpg\" /></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSimilarly, we can compose animations that fluidly remove our Web content from view.\r\n\tFor example, if we wanted our page to disappear into the distance while rotating,\r\n\twe could use something like this:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n\t<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">@keyframes</span> whirlOut {</code></p>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"padding-left: 2em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">to</span> {</code></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">transform</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">scale(0)</span>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span style=\"color: Blue;\">rotateZ(1260deg)</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<code>}</code></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>}</code></p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWith the visual result being:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\">\r\n\t<img style=\"max-width: 95%;\" alt=\"Three screen shots in sequence showing the affect of applying the &quot;whirlOut&quot; animation\" src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/5852.fpauc_2D00_image8.jpg\" /></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSince we can use the full power of CSS Animations to affect the entirety of our\r\n\tWeb content, we have a lot of flexibility in terms of generating these page effects\r\n\t(and we are certainly not limited to just using CSS Transforms). But once we have\r\n\tcomposed the effects that we want to apply to our content, how do we cause them\r\n\tto trigger during the page navigation process?</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tAttaching Animations to &lt;body&gt;</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOur goal is to use trigger animations at strategic times during the browser experience\r\n\tin order to give the appearance of content transitioning into view when a page loads\r\n\tand out of view when the user clicks on a link.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe first intuitive place to add an animation to the body element would be the <code>\r\n\t\tonload</code> JavaScript event. As it turns out however, adding an animation\r\n\twhen <code>onload</code> fires is actually too late. This event actually triggers\r\n\twhen the entirety of the content in our page has finished loading (including any\r\n\timages or other bandwidth-intensive resources). Attaching an animation to <code>onload</code>\r\n\ton a bandwidth-intensive page would result in our content displaying “normally,”\r\n\tfollowed by the animation triggering and re-bringing the content into view. Not\r\n\texactly the effect that we were aiming for.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAlternatively, we could utilize the <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> event that triggers\r\n\twhen the browser has finished parsing the DOM structure of our content (but potentially\r\n\tbefore resources have finished loading). The IE Test Drive <a href=\"http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/HTML5/DOMContentLoaded/Default.html\">\r\n\t\t<code>DOMContentLoaded</code> demo</a> illustrates the difference between these\r\n\ttwo events. However, in cases of complex Web content, a modern browser may choose\r\n\tto perform “progressive” rendering, displaying the page before the entirety of the\r\n\tDOM tree has been loaded. In these situations, the visual result would be similar\r\n\tto the <code>onload</code> scenario.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe optimal place to set up an animation that transitions our page content in view\r\n\tis inline at the top of the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element. This ensures that\r\n\tthe animation will commence right as the content is being rendered (and that the\r\n\tstarting position of the content will be that of the <code>from</code> keyframe\r\n\tof our selected animation). A pleasant side effect of this approach is that the\r\n\tanimation may actually mask any progressive rendering, re-layout or resource loading\r\n\tthat can occur with complex content.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSetting up the animations that transition our content out of view is also interesting.\r\n\tOne could assume that we could attach an <code>onclick</code> handler to all elements\r\n\tof interest in our content (for instance all <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tags) and just\r\n\tset the relevant animation properties (<code>animation-name</code>, <code>animation-duration</code>,\r\n\tetc.) in the callback function. However, if we do not actually <b>delay</b> the\r\n\tnavigation from happening, we will not see our expected fluid transition.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis is a good opportunity to utilize the <a href=\"http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-animations/#AnimationEvent-types\">\r\n\t\tanimation events</a> described in the CSS Animations specification. In particular,\r\n\twe can use the <code>animationend</code> event to detect when the animation has\r\n\tcompleted and then<code> </code>trigger a navigation (by setting <code>window.location.href</code>,\r\n\tfor instance). Thus our <code>onclick</code> will trigger the “remove-from-view”\r\n\tanimation and register a handler for <code>animationend</code> on <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>\r\n\tthat will ensure that the navigation event occurs.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tLive Demo Available</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe’ve created <a href=\"http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Graphics/FullPageAnimations/\">a demonstration\r\n\t\tand tutorial on bringing pages alive with CSS Transforms &amp; Animations</a>\r\n\tthat provide depth and examples beyond what we’ve been able to show here. The tutorial\r\n\titself utilizes full page animations during page navigation that work in <a href=\"http://preview.windows.com/\">\r\n\t\tInternet Explorer 10 on Windows 8</a> as well as recent versions of Chrome and\r\n\tFirefox..</p>\r\n<p>To simply enjoy the page-to-page animations, step through the pages of the tutorial using the “Continue to ...” links in the lower right corner of each page.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAt the end of the tutorial we provide some additional guidance and sample code on\r\n\thow to incorporate these animations with your own Web content.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tConclusion</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCSS Transforms and CSS Animations are two powerful feature-sets that enable richer\r\n\tand more immersive Web experiences. This blog post outlined the considerations of\r\n\tusing CSS Transforms and CSS Animations to bring the entirety of your Web content\r\n\tto life. With a small amount of effort you can create Web pages (even static ones)\r\n\tthat provide a fluid and almost app-like navigation experience.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t—Charilaos “Harris” Papadopoulos, Program Manager Intern, Internet Explorer Graphics</p>\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div><img src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=10340682\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">"

3c36d44b-b1e7-3ae7-cfd6-58ad5f24bdad.description	"<p>\r\n\tToday two Certificate Authorities (CAs), <a href=\"http://www.symantec.com/theme.jsp?themeid=extended-validation-code-signing\">\r\n\t\tSymantec</a> and <a href=\"http://www.digicert.com/code-signing/ev-code-signing.htm\">\r\n\t\t\tDigiCert</a>, announced the introduction of EV code signing certificates.\r\n\tTheir announcement is a positive development for users and businesses because it\r\n\thelps both sides reduce fraud and increase trust. We want to provide some more details\r\n\tabout what this means for Microsoft’s SmartScreen and the Windows 8 application\r\n\tecosystem in general.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tWindows Store &amp; Windows 8 Apps</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe introduction of the <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsstore/archive/2011/12/06/announcing-the-new-windows-store.aspx\">\r\n\t\tWindows Store</a> and <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh974576.aspx\">\r\n\t\t\tWindows 8 Applications</a> will be a significant opportunity for developers\r\n\tto distribute and monetize their applications. Windows 8 Applications are required\r\n\tto pass the Windows Store developer onboarding and application review process. This\r\n\tprocess is designed to give users confidence in the safety of their purchase while\r\n\talso making the install process as frictionless as possible. Windows 8 applications\r\n\tare not in scope for SmartScreen Application Reputation checks or warnings – these\r\n\tapps are reviewed, code signed, licensed &amp; distributed by the Windows store\r\n\tdirectly.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tDesktop Apps</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDesktop applications remain an important part of the Windows experience and Microsoft\r\n\tremains committed to the safety of the desktop experience and our users. We recognize\r\n\tthat Internet Explorer (IE) isn’t the only way users download applications from\r\n\tthe Internet, so Windows 8 now uses SmartScreen to perform an application reputation\r\n\tcheck the first time users launch applications that were downloaded from the Internet.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis evolution of SmartScreen from IE-only to system wide is a significant improvement\r\n\tfor Windows users. We have seen incredible results with this feature in IE9 (more\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.nsslabs.com/research/endpoint-security/browser-security/socially-engineered-malware-global-q3-2011.html\">\r\n\t\there</a> &amp; <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/05/17/smartscreen-174-application-reputation-in-ie9.aspx\">\r\n\t\t\there</a>). Hundreds of millions of users have avoided malware infections\r\n\tdue to these new experiences and we’re happy to bring this protection to Windows\r\n\tusers, regardless of browser choice. For more details on the IE9 application reputation\r\n\tfeature and the data models read this <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/05/17/smartscreen-174-application-reputation-in-ie9.aspx\">\r\n\t\tpost</a>. For more information on security &amp; safety features in Windows\r\n\t8 (including Windows SmartScreen) read this <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2011/09/15/protecting-you-from-malware.aspx\">\r\n\t\tpost</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe deeper integration of SmartScreen Application Reputation also means that desktop\r\n\tapp developers have an additional motivation to sign their code and establish reputation.\r\n\tWe’ve talked in the past about the importance of digitally signing code for both\r\n\testablishing reputation and proving the authenticity of programs. I’m happy to say\r\n\tthe development community has responded to this call to action. Since the release\r\n\tof SmartScreen Application Reputation in IE9 we’ve seen a 10% global increase in\r\n\tsigned downloads, from 73% at IE9 RTM to &gt;83% today.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAs we’ve discussed in the past, SmartScreen builds reputation for both individual\r\n\tprograms and for the certificate used to sign that code. Code signing is important\r\n\tto our reputation intelligence because this higher level identity allows us to build\r\n\treputation across multiple programs signed by a publisher. It is also important\r\n\tfor publishers because signed programs inherit the reputation of the certificate\r\n\twith which they are signed; this means every program a publisher distributes doesn’t\r\n\tneed to build reputation individually.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tEV Code Signing</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tToday we are announcing our support for an important advance in code signing - the\r\n\tavailability of EV code signing Certificates. We’re also announcing that EV code\r\n\tsigning certificates will integrate with the SmartScreen Application Reputation\r\n\ttechnology in Internet Explorer 9, Internet Explorer 10 and in Windows 8.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMicrosoft has been working with the CA industry over the past year to help make\r\n\tEV code signing certificates available. This code signing standard has a couple\r\n\tof key advancements from a safety and identity perspective. First, they require\r\n\ta more rigorous vetting and authentication process similar to that of EV SSL certificates\r\n\tthat are in use today. This process requires a comprehensive identity verification\r\n\tand authentication process for each developer. Secondly, the EV code signing certificates\r\n\trequire the use of hardware to sign applications. This hardware requirement is an\r\n\tadditional protection against theft or unintended use of a code signing certificate.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrograms signed by an EV code signing certificate can immediately establish reputation\r\n\twith SmartScreen reputation services even if no prior reputation exists for that\r\n\tfile or publisher. Other factors are considered when generating reputation and determining\r\n\tproduct experiences and EV-signed programs will be closely monitored over time.\r\n\tWe think the improvements in the vetting and security of these certificates are\r\n\ta great development for both users and developers.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tStarting today, EV code signing certificates are now being issued by <a href=\"http://www.symantec.com/theme.jsp?themeid=extended-validation-code-signing\">\r\n\t\tSymantec</a> and <a href=\"http://www.digicert.com/code-signing/ev-code-signing.htm\">\r\n\t\t\tDigiCert</a>, and the integration with SmartScreen is already live (IE9,\r\n\tIE10 &amp; Win8).\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDetractors may claim that SmartScreen is “forcing” developers to spend money on\r\n\tcertificates. It should be stressed that EV code signing certificates are not required\r\n\tto build or maintain reputation with SmartScreen. Files signed with standard code\r\n\tsigning certificates and even unsigned files continue to build reputation as they\r\n\thave since Application Reputation was introduced in IE9 last year. However, the\r\n\tpresence of an EV code signing certificate is a strong indicator that the file was\r\n\tsigned by an entity that has passed a rigorous validation process and was signed\r\n\twith hardware which allows our systems to establish reputation for that entity more\r\n\tquickly than unsigned or non-EV code signed programs.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tBest Practices</h2>\r\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">\r\n\tDevelopers should still follow the best practices we’ve suggested in past blog posts.\r\n\tWe have added to that guidance the additional options of distributing apps thru\r\n\tthe Windows Store and the option of EV code signing:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"margin-top: 0;\">\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-top: 1em;\"><b>Distribute your apps through the Windows Store<br />\r\n\t</b>Windows 8 Applications are required to pass the Windows Store developer onboarding\r\n\t\tand application review process.

Digital certificates allow data to be aggregated and assigned to a single\r\n\t\tcertificate rather than many individual programs. Although not required, programs\r\n\t\tsigned by an EV code signing certificate can immediately establish reputation with\r\n\t\tSmartScreen reputation services even if no prior reputation exists for that file\r\n\t\tor publisher. EV code signing certificates also have a unique identifier which makes\r\n\t\tit easier to maintain reputation across certificate renewals. Only Authenticode\r\n\t\tCertificates issued by a CA that is a member of the Windows Root Certificate Program\r\n\t\tcan establish reputation.<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tAt this time, <a href=\"http://www.symantec.com/theme.jsp?themeid=extended-validation-code-signing\">\r\n\t\t\tSymantec</a> and <a href=\"http://www.digicert.com/code-signing/ev-code-signing.htm\">\r\n\t\t\t\tDigiCert</a> are offering EV code signing certificates.</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-top: 1em;\"><b>Don’t sign or distribute malicious code</b><br />\r\n\t\tDistributing code detected as malicious will remove the reputation from a file and\r\n\t\talso any reputation from the associated digital certificate – even if signed with\r\n\t\tan EV code signing certificate.</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-top: 1em;\"><b>Apply for a Windows Logo or Windows 8 Desktop App Certification</b><br />\r\n\t\tLearn more about these programs here:<br />\r\n\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t\t<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/hh749939\">Windows\r\n\t\t\t\t8 Desktop App Certification</a> (required for Windows Store submissions)</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd371701(v=vs.85).aspx\">\r\n\t\t\t\tWindows Logo Program</a></li>\r\n\t\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe’re pleased with the announcement today of the availability of EV code signing\r\n\tcertificates and we’re also happy to be able to bring SmartScreen Application Reputation\r\n\tto a new set of Windows users soon with Windows 8.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t—Jeb Haber, Lead Program Manager, SmartScreen\r\n</p>\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div><img src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=10339518\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">"

1adbd77e-752c-9bf1-8250-181c34ce4e77.description	"<p>We’re pleased to share that three new <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2011/04/webperf\">W3C Web Performance Working Group</a> specifications moved to W3C Candidate Recommendations. Accurately measuring the performance characteristics of Web applications is critical to making the Web faster. In addition, developers need the ability to effectively use the underlying hardware to improve the performance of their applications. Over the last two years, companies including Microsoft, Google, Mozilla, Intel, and Facebook have been working toward these goals through the working group. This is a great example of what’s possible when the industry and community come together through the W3C.</p>\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/navigation-timing/\">Navigation Timing</a>, <a href=\"https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webperf/raw-file/tip/specs/ResourceTiming/Overview.html\">Resource Timing</a>, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-user-timing-20110811/\">User Timing</a> and <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-performance-timeline-20110811/\">Performance Timeline</a> specifications help developers accurately measure Web application performance. The first three specifications provide developers with information related to the navigation of the document, resources on the page, and developer scripts, respectively. The Performance Timeline specification defines a unifying interface to retrieve this timing data. Prior to these API’s it was not possible for developers to accurately measure their site performance.</p>\r\n<p>To ensure these performance metrics are measured in the most accurate way possibly, the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-hr-time-20120313/\">High Resolution Time</a> specification defines a sub-millisecond clock resolution. This interface not only benefits accurate measurements of performance metrics, but also allows better frame rate calculations and synchronization of animations or audio cues.  For the first time developers can measure operations with sub-millisecond accuracy.</p>\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/page-visibility/\">Page Visibility</a>, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/animation-timing/\">Timing control for script-based animations</a>, and <a href=\"http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webperf/raw-file/tip/specs/setImmediate/Overview.html\">Efficient Script Yielding</a> specifications help developers write more CPU- and power-efficient Web applications. The Page Visibility API allows for programmatically determining the current visibility state of the page. Developers can use this data to make better CPU- and power-efficiency decisions, e.g., throttling down activity when the page is in the background tab. The <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> API, from the Timing control for script-based animations specification, allows for creating more efficient JavaScript animations. Finally, the <code>setImmediate</code> API, from the Efficient Script Yielding specification, allows developers to efficiently yield control flow to the user agent and receive an immediate callback, efficiently leveraging the CPU.</p>\r\n<p>In order to ensure Web developers only have to write code once and have it work interoperably in all browsers, the Working Group has worked diligently these last two years to standardize these APIs. The table below shows the maturity level of all the specifications currently being edited in the Working Group.</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><div style=\"display: inline-block; text-align: left;

6722a551-5e3c-2953-cde6-c075a965a6bc.description	"<p>IE10 in <a href=\"http://preview.windows.com/\">Windows 8 Release Preview</a> adds support for a <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/#constructorBlob\"><code>Blob</code> constructor</a>. We earlier <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2012/01/27/creating-files-through-blobbuilder.aspx\">wrote about</a> and <a href=\"http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/HTML5/BlobBuilder/\">demonstrated</a> IE10&rsquo;s support for a <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/file-writer-api/#idl-def-BlobBuilder\"><code>BlobBuilder</code> interface</a>, an in-progress interface in the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/file-writer-api/\">File API: Writer W3C Working Draft</a>. This interface enables developers to work with files on the client PC. Recently, the W3C working group deprecated the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/file-writer-api/#idl-def-BlobBuilder\"><code>BlobBuilder</code> interface</a> in favor of a new <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/#constructorBlob\"><code>Blob</code> constructor</a>. This post explains the differences between the two.</p>\r\n<h2>Comparing Blob Constructor and BlobBuilder Interface</h2>\r\n<p>Both the <code>Blob</code> constructor and the <code>BlobBuilder</code> interface enable Web developers to create files on the client. The difference is in the syntax. Whereas <code>BlobBuilder</code> requires each portion of the blob to be appended during a separate call to the append method, the <code>Blob</code> constructor can take an array of arguments. Here&rsquo;s how to create a simple text file using both <code>BlobBuilder</code> and the <code>Blob</code> constructor:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: #006400;\">// using the Blob constructor</span></code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">var</span> textBlob1 = <span style=\"color: blue;\">new</span> Blob([<span style=\"color: maroon;\">\"Hello\"</span>, <span style=\"color: maroon;\">\" world!\"</span>], { type: <span style=\"color: maroon;\">\"text/plain\"</span>, endings: <span style=\"color: maroon;\">\"transparent\"</span> });</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 2em;\"><code>&nbsp;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: #006400;\">// using the MSBlobBuilder interface</span></code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">var</span> bb = <span style=\"color: blue;\">new</span> MSBlobBuilder();</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>bb.append(<span style=\"color: maroon;\">\"Hello\"</span>);</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>bb.append(<span style=\"color: maroon;\">\" world!\"</span>);</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">var</span> textBlob2 = bb.getBlob(<span style=\"color: maroon;\">\"text/plain\"</span>);</code></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>The <code>Blob</code> constructor takes two arguments, the array of content to put into the blob and an optional dictionary object which can include two members, <code>type</code> and <code>endings</code>. The array of content for the blob may contain blob objects, text strings or array buffers.</p>\r\n<p>Recent versions of Firefox and Chrome also support the <code>Blob</code> constructor. IE10 still supports the prefixed <code>MSBlobBuilder</code> interface in addition to the new <code>Blob</code> constructor. At this time, Firefox and Chrome also support their vendor-prefixed <code>BlobBuilder</code> interface.</p>\r\n<h2>Feature Detecting the Blob Constructor</h2>\r\n<p>As with all new features, we <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2010/04/14/same-markup-writing-cross-browser-code.aspx\">recommend using feature detection</a> to determine if the <code>Blob</code> constructor is available in the browser your code is running on. You can use something like&nbsp;this:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">if</span> (<span style=\"color: blue;\">typeof</span> Blob !== <span style=\"color: maroon;\">\"undefined\"</span>) {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: #006400;\">// use the Blob constructor</span></code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>} <span style=\"color: blue;\">else</span> <span style=\"color: blue;\">if</span> (window.MSBlobBuilder || window.WebKitBlobBuilder || window.MozBlobBuilder) {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: #006400;\">// use the supported vendor-prefixed BlobBuilder</span></code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>} <span style=\"color: blue;\">else</span> {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: #006400;\">// neither Blob constructor nor BlobBuilder is supported</span></code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>If you run the <a href=\"http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/HTML5/BlobBuilder/\"><code>BlobBuilder</code> Test Drive demo</a> with the F12 developer tools console window open, it will log whether the blobs are being built via the <code>Blob</code> constructor or via <code>BlobBuilder</code>.</p>\r\n<p>The addition of the <code>Blob</code> constructor to IE10 enables you to write standards-compliant code that works across browsers.</p>\r\n<p>&mdash;Sharon Newman, Program Manager, Internet Explorer</p><div style=\"clear:both;\"></div><img src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=10332101\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">"

f4cd2331-2526-a738-9871-810f9682e31b.description	"<p>\r\n\tIE10 in <a href=\"http://preview.windows.com/\">Windows 8 Release Preview</a> updates\r\n\tthe <code>responseXML</code> from an <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> to return a native\r\n\tXML document by default. This change applies to IE10&rsquo;s Standards and Quirks\r\n\tdocument modes, making them interoperable with other modern browsers and consistent\r\n\twith a “same markup” approach. Compatibility document modes 5, 7, 8, and 9 are unchanged.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis change may impact sites that were expecting <code>responseXML</code> to contain\r\n\tan MSXML document and depended on MSXML-specific functionality such as <code>selectNodes</code>. In these cases, you may request that IE10 return an MSXML by setting\r\n\tthe <code>responseType</code> member of your <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> object to <code>'msxml-document'</code>. If your code does not depend on MSXML-specific functionality, IE10&rsquo;s native XML document should work for you.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNative XML support in IE9 brought DOM parity to XML and HTML and enabled XML fragments\r\n\tto be inserted and rendered directly within a page (even in HTML). IE9 also simplified\r\n\tconverting between XML and DOM with the addition of <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2010/10/15/domparser-and-xmlserializer-in-ie9-beta.aspx\">\r\n\t\tDOMParser and XMLSerializer</a>. IE10 completes this transition by updating\r\n\t<code>responseXML</code> to return a native XML document.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLike IE9, IE10 previews before the <a href=\"http://preview.windows.com/\">Windows 8 Release\r\n\t\tPreview</a> returned an <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms763742(v=vs.85).aspx\">\r\n\t\t\tMSXML</a> document for <code>responseXML</code>.

d082ffd5-94dd-0f01-a2f9-41af47eb33b2.description	"<p>\r\n\tThe <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/04/15/the-ie10-user-agent-string.aspx\">\r\n\t\tIE10 user agent string</a> was originally introduced in the first platform preview\r\n\tof IE10. In Windows 8 Release Preview we made two additions to aid server-side feature\r\n\tdetection.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<b>The first addition</b> enables detecting whether a machine has touch-capable\r\n\thardware via a new <code>Touch</code> token. Using this token you can present a\r\n\ttouch-friendly version of your site to users with touch-capable hardware (typically,\r\n\tin the case where your normal site is not touch-friendly). Keep in mind that users\r\n\twith touch-capable hardware may also use a mouse and keyboard. You can see where\r\n\tthis token fits into the user agent string in the examples below.\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-top: 0.5em\">IE10 on a machine without touch-capable hardware:<br />\r\n\t\t<code style=\"margin-left: 0.25in\">Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows NT 6.2;\r\n\t\t\tTrident/6.0)</code></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-top: 0.5em\">IE10 on a machine with touch-capable hardware:<br />\r\n\t\t<code style=\"margin-left: 0.25in\">Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows NT 6.2;\r\n\t\t\tTrident/6.0; <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">Touch</span>)</code></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIf you're detecting touch support client-side, do not sniff the user agent string;\r\n\tuse <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh772144(v=vs.85).aspx\"><code>\r\n\t\tnavigator.msMaxTouchPoints</code></a> instead. If the property exists and returns\r\n\ta value greater than zero, the user’s PC has touch capability. For example:</p>\r\n<div style=\"padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n\t<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">var</span> hasTouch = navigator.msMaxTouchPoints &gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t0;</code>\r\n\t\t</p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<b>The second addition</b> to the IE10 user agent string is a new architecture token\r\n\tfor ARM devices running Windows RT. This complements the existing values for other\r\n\tarchitectures. The examples below show how this compares to a few other configurations.\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-top: 0.5em\">32-bit IE10 on 32-bit Windows:<br />\r\n\t\t<code style=\"margin-left: 0.25in\">Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows NT 6.2;\r\n\t\t\tTrident/6.0) </code></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-top: 0.5em\">32-bit IE10 on 64-bit Windows:<br />\r\n\t\t<code style=\"margin-left: 0.25in\">Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows NT 6.2;\r\n\t\t\t<span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">WOW64;</span> Trident/6.0) </code>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-top: 0.5em\">64-bit IE10 on 64-bit Windows:<br />\r\n\t\t<code style=\"margin-left: 0.25in\">Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows NT 6.2;\r\n\t\t\t<span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">Win64; x64;</span> Trident/6.0) </code>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-top: 0.5em\">IE10 on Windows RT:<br />\r\n\t\t<code style=\"margin-left: 0.25in\">Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows NT 6.2;\r\n\t\t\t<span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">ARM;</span> Trident/6.0) </code>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThese additions apply to both desktop and Metro style IE10 since they expose the\r\n\tsame platform capabilities. We recommend optimizing your site’s experience around\r\n\tthe capabilities of the system (like Touch) through <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2010/04/14/same-markup-writing-cross-browser-code.aspx\">feature detection</a>, rather than\r\n\tbrowser or environment detection. Where content depends on plug-ins, use the\r\n\t<a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2012/01/31/web-sites-and-a-plug-in-free-web.aspx\">\r\n\t\trequiresActiveX prompt</a> to help users switch to desktop IE10 until the content\r\n\tcan be made plug-in free.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t—Tony Ross, Program Manager, Internet Explorer</p>\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div><img src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=10329304\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">"

This security update resolves two privately reported vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer. The vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted Web page using Internet Explorer. An attacker who successfully exploited any of these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights. This security update is rated Critical for Internet Explorer 9 on Windows clients and Moderate for Internet Explorer 9 on Windows servers.

59c3e8e8-622f-7975-0c55-e428f2482135.description	"<p>The quality and correctness of different browsers’ HTML5 engines continue to vary widely. We continue to contribute to the test suites under development at W3C to further the goal of web platform interoperability and same markup. In total, we have submitted <a href=\"http://samples.msdn.microsoft.com/ietestcenter/\">7573 tests</a> that you can view at the IE Test Center as well. As different browsers improve their same-markup support, we can all realize the promise of HTML5.</p>\r\n<p>The title of this post refers to the <a href=\"http://testthewebforward.org/\">week-end event</a> hosted by Adobe on June 15 and 16 at their San Francisco office. Dozens of volunteers joined W3C experts and members from Adobe, Google, Mozilla, Apple, HP, and Microsoft to learn about Web standards testing, how to write CSS and SVG tests, how to file good bugs, as well as the tools available for test suite management.</p>\r\n<p>The meeting then turned into a test ‘hack-a-thon’ fueled by free drinks and food throughout the day. Volunteers spent most of their Saturday writing new test cases for the <a href=\"http://dev.w3.org/csswg/cssom/\">CSS OM</a>, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transforms/\">Transforms</a>, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-background/\">Backgrounds &amp; Borders</a>, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-exclusions/\">Exclusions</a>, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/\">SVG</a>, and other modules. Participants were then <a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/webplatform/2012/06/20/test-the-web-forward-weekend/\">nominated for several prizes</a>. </p>\r\n<h2>Testing Web Standards</h2>\r\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:0;\">Adobe’s Alan Stearns <a href=\"http://testthewebforward.org/slides/alanstearns/#/\">introduced</a> the participants to the general principles of W3C testing and the role of testing in moving specifications forward. In particular, establishing browsers’ individual pass rate for a given specification is not a goal of W3C test suites. In order for a specification to become a W3C Recommendation the Working Group must prove it can be implemented. In practice this means:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"margin-top:0;\">\r\n<li>Creating a test case for each requirement in the specification (these are known as <i>normative statements</i>)</li>\r\n<li>Verifying that at least two separate implementations pass each test</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Note the difference between ‘at least two browsers must pass the entire test suite’ and ‘at least two browsers must pass each test in the test suite’. Browser testers usually describe this phase as ‘testing the spec’. </p>\r\n<p>But an important side-effect of this testing process is to establish a common interoperable baseline that all browsers can develop and test against. Test suites help find bugs across all browsers and can sometimes identify issues in the spec.</p>\r\n<h2>Writing CSS and SVG Tests</h2>\r\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:0;\">There are three different types of tests:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"margin-top:0;\">\r\n<li><b>Stand-alone tests</b> typically rely on visual verification: <a href=\"http://test.csswg.org/suites/css2.1/20110323/html4/at-import-001.htm\">if a failure condition occurs, red content will show</a>. </li>\r\n<li><b>Reference tests</b> compare <a href=\"http://test.csswg.org/suites/css3-multicol/nightly-unstable/html4/columns-invalid-001.htm\">a test</a> against <a href=\"http://test.csswg.org/suites/css3-multicol/nightly-unstable/html4/reference/columns-toolong-ref.htm\">a visual reference</a> that has no dependency on the feature being tested.  Note that the test includes a link to the reference test against which is should be compared.</li>\r\n<li><b>CSS Object Model tests</b> depend on a JavaScript test harness; they verify that the object model reflects what static style sheets specify. For instance, this <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/MediaQueries/20120229/test_media_queries.html\">CSS media query test</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>W3C’s Doug Schepers covered <a href=\"http://testthewebforward.org/slides/dougschepers/#/\">SVG testing</a> while Adobe’s Rebecca Hauck and Jacob Goldstein provided a <a href=\"http://adobe.github.com/web-platform/presentations/test-the-web-forward-tutorial/index.html#/\">test writing tutorial</a>. Peter Linss, CSS Working Group co-chair, offered a deep dive on the <a href=\"http://testthewebforward.org/slides/peterlinss/ttwf.pdf\">CSS testing framework</a> including the test suite build system and management tools such as Shepherd.</p>\r\n<h2>Filing Good Bugs</h2>\r\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:0;\">Mozilla’s Elika Etemad then gave attendees advice on what makes <a href=\"http://fantasai.inkedblade.net/style/talks/filing-good-bugs/\">a good browser bug report</a>:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"margin-top:0;\">\r\n<li>The issue is specific and reproducible</li>\r\n<li>The build and platform are identified</li>\r\n<li>You have looked for duplicates</li>\r\n<li>It includes steps to reproduce the problem</li>\r\n<li>The expected and actual results are described</li>\r\n<li>If possible, the issue has been reduced i.e. all HTML, JavaScript and CSS that is not necessary to reproduce the problem has been eliminated from the problem page and the remainder attached to the bug.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Building a Test Suite</h2>\r\n<p>Building a test suite is a significant investment. One of the reasons it took a long time for CSS2.1 to reach the Recommendation stage was the size of the specification and the underlying number of requirements to test. The <a href=\"http://test.csswg.org/suites/css2.1/20110323/\">latest version of the test suite</a> contains 9,422 tests. </p>\r\n<p>Microsoft <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2009/01/27/microsoft-submits-thousands-more-css-2-1-tests-to-the-w3c.aspx\">contributed</a> over 7,000 of those tests, and we are continually <a href=\"http://samples.msdn.microsoft.com/ietestcenter/\">contributing more tests for other standard specifications</a>.</p>\r\n<p>In IE10, we have added support for <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh673549(v=vs.85).aspx\">a long list of new standard features across CSS, HTML, SVG and the DOM</a>.

Gradients were first added to the specification in 2009. They were based on the <a href=\"http://www.webkit.org/blog/175/introducing-css-gradients/\">\r\n\t\t\tgradients introduced in WebKit</a>, but with improvements to the syntax. At that time, WebKit had an implementation for <code style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">-webkit-gradient()</code>.\r\n\tThe CSS Working Group iterated on the feature and altered its syntax. Radial gradients and linear gradients would be specified with separate property values, <code\r\n\t\tstyle=\"white-space: nowrap;\">linear-gradient()</code> and <code style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">radial-gradient()</code>. Fast forward a couple years and all major\r\n\tbrowsers—Chrome, Firefox, IE10 Platform Preview 1, and Opera—had introduced support for the version of CSS gradients described in the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-css3-images-20110217/\">\r\n\t\tW3C Working Draft of 17 February 2011</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen the Working Draft was closely scrutinized, several changed were suggested and after much discussion the specification was edited to reflect these changes.\r\n\tThe major changes, listed in the table above, improved the old specification by addressing issues of clarity and consistency. For instance, in the old angle coordinate\r\n\tsystem, positive angles increased in a counterclockwise manner. This is in contrast to CSS Transforms and SVG Transforms, where positive angle rotations occur in\r\n\ta clockwise manner. With the specification change, angles that describe CSS gradients are now consistent across other CSS angles and increase in a clockwise manner.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the process of changing gradients’ syntax, compatibility was a recognized concern despite the specification being in a Working Draft stage. Not all cases are\r\n\tcompatible, but much existing content will continue to work. Default values remain the same, so their rendering will be unchanged. For gradient-line direction,\r\n\tthe required “<code style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">to</code>” preposition both adds clarity and changes the valid grammar. Existing content with unprefixed gradients\r\n\tusing the old syntax will be invalid, thereby falling back on the vendor-prefixed version.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tUpdate Your Unprefixed Gradients</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNow that CSS3 Gradients are stable, we encourage you to update your gradients markup to the correct Candidate Recommendation unprefixed gradient syntax. The Internet Explorer 10 Guide for Developers includes <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh673532(v=vs.85).aspx\">full updated documentation</a> of the unprefixed syntax.  You may\r\n\talso remove instances of the <code style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">-ms-</code> prefixed gradients, as IE10 supports the unprefixed version. If you’re using corner\r\n\tkeywords or angles to describe gradient direction, you may want to verify that your gradients still render as desired.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhile vendor-prefixed gradients still work in IE10 and other browsers, adding correct support for unprefixed gradients future-proofs your content.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t—Jennifer Yu, Program Manager, Internet Explorer</p>\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div><img src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=10323746\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">"

Adobe Flash content on compatible Web sites will now play in Metro style IE10. Metro style IE10 with Flash on Windows 8 enables people to see more of the Web working with high quality, especially compared with the experience in other touch-first or tablet experiences.</p>\r\n<p>On Windows 8, Internet Explorer 10 on the desktop and Metro style IE use the same integrated Adobe Flash Player with no need to download or install an additional player. IE10 on the desktop provides the same full Flash support as previous versions of IE that relied on the Flash Player plug-in from Adobe and continues to support other 3rd party plug-ins. Metro style IE continues to provide no support for 3rd party ActiveX controls or plug-ins. </p>\r\n<p>While any site can play Flash content in IE10 on the Windows desktop, only sites that are listed in the Flash section of the Compatibility View (<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/gg622935(v=vs.85).aspx\">CV</a>) list can play Flash content within Metro style IE. (Being listed in the Flash section does <i>not</i> affect a site’s document mode.) We place sites with Flash content on this list if doing so delivers the best user experience in Metro style IE with those sites. For example, how responsive is the content to touch? Does it work well with the onscreen keyboard? Is it battery-life friendly? Do visual prompts comply with the Metro style user experience guidelines? Sites that rely on capabilities that are not supported within the Metro style experience, for example, Flash rollover events and P2P functionality, and don’t degrade gracefully in their absence are better off running in IE with Flash on the desktop.\r\n<p>Site developers continue to control the content they serve to browsers. Developers can send HTML5 content to Metro style IE or express their preference that Metro style IE prompt users to run their site on the desktop (see details <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2012/01/31/web-sites-and-a-plug-in-free-web.aspx\">here</a>). Developers can also request that their site is considered for addition to the CV list for Flash. Additional technical information and details can be found in the <a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=256383\">document posted on MSDN</a>. These details include how developers can test Flash content on their own sites in Metro style IE and how to submit their sites for consideration for the CV list. The documentation also includes a best practices guide to help developers, designers, and content publishers create experiences with Flash that play well in Metro style IE. </p>\r\n<p>—Rob Mauceri, Group Program Manager, Internet Explorer</p>\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div><img src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=10323065\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">"

Earlier we wrote about <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2012/04/20/guidelines-for-building-touch-friendly-sites.aspx\">first steps\r\n\t\t\tWeb developers should take</a> to make sure their sites are touch-friendly and how to build new experiences that work well across input devices, including\r\n\tmulti-touch, using hardware agnostic <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/09/20/touch-input-for-ie10-and-metro-style-apps.aspx\">pointer events.</a>\r\n\tThis post covers IE10’s <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh772076(v=vs.85).aspx\">gesture events</a>. An example of gesture events is the <a href=\"http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Browser/BrowserSurface/\">\r\n\t\tBrowser Surface</a> Test Drive demo shown below.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\">\r\n\t<img style=\"max-width: 95%; box-shadow: 3px 3px 8px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25);\" alt=\"Screen shot of the Browser Surface demo showing pictures randomly arranged on the surface.\"\r\n\t\tsrc=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/0083.gr_2D00_image1.jpg\" /><br />\r\n\t<span style=\"display: inline-block; padding-top: 4px;\">Users can drag, pinch, and rotate photos using the <a href=\"http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Browser/BrowserSurface/\">Browser Surface demo</a></span></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIE10 in the Windows 8 Release Preview introduces <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh968249(v=vs.85).aspx\">gesture recognition objects</a> in JavaScript.\r\n\tSites can create gesture objects, decide which pointers (mouse, pen, or touch contacts) to process, and direct the gesture events at whatever element is desired.\r\n\tThe browser then calculates what gesture is being performed and notifies the page via events. This enables developers to build gesture experiences not yet natively\r\n\tpossible in any other browser. These include multiple concurrent gestures, for example, rotating two puzzle pieces with your hands.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLet’s take a look at how this works in code.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tCreating a Gesture Object</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe first step in handling gestures in your site is to instantiate a gesture object.</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n\t<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">var</span> myGesture = <span style=\"color: Blue;\">new</span> MSGesture();</code></p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNext, give the gesture a target element. This is the element to which the browser will fire gesture events. It’s also the element that determines the coordinate\r\n\tspace for the events.\r\n</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n\t<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>elm = document.getElementById(<span style=\"color: Maroon;\">&quot;someElement&quot;</span>);</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>myGesture.target = elm;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>elm.addEventListener(<span style=\"color: Maroon;\">&quot;MSGestureChange&quot;</span>, handleGesture);</code></p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFinally, tell the gesture object which pointers to process in its gesture recognition.\r\n</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n\t<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>elm.addEventListener(<span style=\"color: Maroon;\">&quot;MSPointerDown&quot;</span>, <span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span> (evt) {</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">// adds the current mouse, pen, or touch contact for gesture recognition</span></code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>myGesture.addPointer(evt.pointerId);</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>});</code></p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNote: don’t forget you need to use <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh772044(v=vs.85).aspx\"><code style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">–ms-touch-action</code></a>\r\n\tto <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2012/04/20/guidelines-for-building-touch-friendly-sites.aspx\">configure the element to not perform default touch</a>\r\n\tactions like panning and zooming, and instead provide pointer events for the input.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tHandling Gesture Events</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOnce a gesture object has a valid target and at least one pointer added to it, it will begin to fire gesture events. The gesture events come in 2 flavors: static\r\n\tgestures (like tap or hold) and dynamic gestures (like pinch, rotate, or swipe).</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n\tTap</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe most basic gesture recognition is a Tap. When a tap is detected, the <code>MSGestureTap</code> event is fired at the target element of the gesture object. Different\r\n\tfrom the click event, the tap gesture only fires when a user touches (or presses a mouse button, or touches a pen) down and up without moving. This is often useful\r\n\tif you want to differentiate between a user tapping on an element versus dragging the element.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n\tPress and Hold</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n\tA press and hold gesture happens when a user touches down with one finger, holds for a moment, and lifts without moving. During a press &amp; hold interaction,\r\n\tthe <code>MSGestureHold</code> event fires more than once for the various states of the gesture:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>element.addEventListener(<span style=\"color: Maroon;\">&quot;MSGestureHold&quot;</span>, handleHold);</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span> handleHold(evt) {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">if</span> (evt.detail &amp; evt.MSGESTURE_FLAG_BEGIN) {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><code><span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">// Begin signals the start of a gesture. For the Hold gesture, this means the user has been holding long enough in place that the gesture will become a complete press &amp; hold if the finger is lifted.</span></code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">if</span> (evt.detail &amp; evt.MSGESTURE_FLAG_END) {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><code><span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">// End signals the end of the gesture.</span></code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">if</span> (evt.detail &amp; evt.MSGESTURE_FLAG_CANCEL) {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><code><span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">// Cancel signals the user started the gesture but cancelled it. For hold, this occurs when the user drags away before lifting. This flag is sent together with the End flag, signaling the gesture recognition is complete.</span></code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h3>\r\n\tDynamic Gestures (pinch, rotate, swipe, and drag)</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDynamic gestures, like pinch or rotate, are reported in the form of transforms similar to CSS 2D Transforms. Three events are fired for dynamic gestures: <code>MSGestureStart</code>,\r\n\t<code>MSGestureChange</code> (fires repeatedly as the gesture continues), and <code>MSGestureEnd</code>. Each event contains <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh772076(v=vs.85).aspx\">\r\n\t\tinformation</a> about scale (pinch), rotation, translation, and velocity.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBecause dynamic gestures report transforms, it’s easy to use <code>MSGesture</code> with CSS 2D Transforms to manipulate an element like a photo or puzzle piece. For example, you\r\n\tcan enable scaling, rotating, and dragging of element as follows:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n\t<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>targetElement.addEventListener(<span style=\"color: Maroon;\">&quot;MSGestureChange&quot;</span>, manipulateElement);</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span> manipulateElement(e) {</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">// Uncomment the following code if you want to disable the built-in inertia provided by dynamic gesture recognition</span></code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">// if (e.detail == e.MSGESTURE_FLAG_INERTIA)</span></code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">// return;</span></code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 2em\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>&nbsp;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">var</span> m = <span style=\"color: Blue;\">new</span> MSCSSMatrix(e.target.style.transform); <span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">//\r\n\t\t\t\tGet the latest CSS transform on the element</span></code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>e.target.style.transform = m</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>.translate(e.offsetX, e.offsetY) <span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">// Move the transform origin under the center of the gesture</span></code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>.rotate(e.rotation * 180 / Math.PI) <span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">// Apply Rotation</span></code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>.scale(e.scale) <span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">// Apply Scale</span></code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>.translate(e.translationX, e.translationY) <span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">// Apply Translation</span></code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>.translate(-e.offsetX, -e.offsetY); <span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">// Move the transform origin back</span></code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>}</code></p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDynamic gestures like scale and rotate are supported with mouse by rotating the mouse wheel with the CTRL or SHIFT modifier keys, respectively.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tSummary</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIE10’s gesture events enable you to build touch experiences not currently possible in any other browser.

This gives Web developers a simple tool to control automatic content scaling across various window dimensions. In particular,\r\n\tit enables Web sites to easily adapt to Windows 8 Metro style browser in the snapped view and portrait orientation.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tAuto-Scaling and When It Is Used</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMost websites have prioritized optimization for a 1024 pixel wide window.  This ensures a good user experience for a wide variety of displays when the browser is maximized.  However, sites may not work well on new form factors like tablets and portrait screen orientation if they haven't <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/01/12/the-css-corner-css3-media-queries.aspx\">optimized for other window sizes</a> as well.  In particular, pages often clip or distort layout when viewed in a narrow width.\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\">\r\n\t<img style=\"max-width: 40%; border: 1px solid #999; box-shadow: 3px 3px 8px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25);\" alt=\"Screen shot of TechCrunch Web site displayed in a very narrow Window. Only the left edge of the site content is visible.\"\r\n\t\tsrc=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/3426.aystdwsumv_2D00_image1.png\" /><img alt=\"Screen shot of a Wikipedia displayed in a very narrow Window. The left navigation bar is visible; the featured article is readable but wrapped in a very narrow column.\"\r\n\t\t\tstyle=\"margin-left: 2em; max-width: 40%; border: 1px solid #999; box-shadow: 3px 3px 8px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25);\" src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/3010.aystdwsumv_2D00_image2.png\" /><br />\r\n\t<span style=\"display: inline-block; padding-top: 4px;\">TechCrunch and Wikipedia displayed in very narrow windows</span></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis narrow layout is particularly important in Windows 8, where the snapped view of the Metro style browser is in this exact state. This situation also occurs for portrait mode on slate devices due to the smaller form factor.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the Metro style browser, the snapped view and portrait mode are auto-scaled by default to ensure at least 1024 pixels of layout width. Mobile devices take <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/iemobile/archive/2010/11/22/the-ie-mobile-viewport-on-windows-phone-7.aspx\">\r\n\t\ta similar approach</a> when displaying non-mobile-optimized sites on a narrow form factor. Since most sites are built to work well at 1024 pixels, this ensures\r\n\tthat they are laid out well and do not clip content by default.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\">\r\n\t<img style=\"max-width: 40%; border: 1px solid #999; box-shadow: 3px 3px 8px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25);\" alt=\"Screen shot of TechCrunch Web site displayed in Metro style snapped view.

In addition to fitting the site into a narrower region, this also may require\r\n\tchanges to image sizes, reordering of content, alternative tools for site navigation, or other fundamental changes to content.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIf your site has already made these modifications for narrow windows, then Device Adaptation can be used to override the default scale.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor some great examples of adaptive layouts, check out <a href=\"http://mediaqueri.es/\">Media Queries</a>. Metal Toad Media also has a great article discussing <a\r\n\t\thref=\"http://www.metaltoad.com/blog/simple-device-diagram-responsive-design-planning\">layout width support</a> based on prevalent devices and screen sizes in\r\n\tthe market.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tUsing @-ms-viewport</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<b>Simple support for the snapped view.</b> If your site is already capable of a 320 pixel width layout, you can easily choose to show that version in the snapped view. Combining\r\n\tDevice Adaptation with CSS media queries allows the auto-scaling feature to be overridden selectively. This CSS overrides the default auto-scaling, and instead\r\n\tenforces a consistent 320 pixel layout width for all windows 320 pixels wide or narrower:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n\t<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">@media</span> screen and (max-width: 320px) {</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">@-ms-viewport</span> { <span style=\"color: Red;\">width</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">320px</span>; }</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>}</code></p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen the window is less than 320 pixels wide the content will be scaled down to fit. For example, a 300 pixel wide window will show the content at 93.75%\r\n\tscale. For larger widths, IE10’s normal scaling applies (for example, when the Metro style browser is in portrait mode).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDevice adaptation degrades gracefully in browsers which do not yet support it. These browsers can still benefit from narrow layout support—they just won’t auto-scale\r\n\tto fit content to the window.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<b>Portrait support.</b> If your site supports a 768 pixel wide layout as well, then portrait mode support can be easily added with a second viewport rule:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n\t<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">@media</span> screen and (max-width: 320px) {</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">@-ms-viewport</span> { <span style=\"color: Red;\">width</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">320px</span>; }</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>}</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 2em\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>&nbsp;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">@media</span> screen and (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 959px) {</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">@-ms-viewport</span> { <span style=\"color: Red;\">width</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">768px</span>; }</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>}</code></p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe recommend testing your site in layout widths of 768 pixels (portrait on most slates) and 320 pixels (snapped Metro style browser) in addition to 1024 pixels and wider (landscape).

89fa44d2-500f-1c56-8938-fc4954f38fc1.description	"<p>In an <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2012/06/13/advances-in-javascript-performance-in-ie10-and-windows-8.aspx\">earlier post</a> we discussed JavaScript performance improvements introduced in IE10. Today we published <a href=\"http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/performance/bubbles/\">Bubbles</a>, originally inspired by Alex Gavriolov&rsquo;s simulation <a href=\"http://www.bubblemark.com/\">BubbleMark</a>, to explore some of these advances. The current version has been greatly expanded to take advantage of the new features of the Web platform and includes characteristics common to HTML5 games. In this post we peek under the hood to see how the demo is constructed and examine the main factors that affect its performance.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\"><img style=\"max-width: 95%; border: 1px solid #999; box-shadow: 3px 3px 8px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25);\" alt=\"Screen shot of Bubbles demo running in Metro style IE10 on the Windows 8 Release Preview\" src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/0841.uthb_2D00_image3.jpg\" /><br /> <span style=\"display: inline-block; padding-top: 4px;\"><a href=\"http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/performance/bubbles/\">Bubbles demo</a> running in Metro style IE10 on the Windows 8 Release Preview</span></p>\r\n<h2>The Structure of the Demo</h2>\r\n<p>The demo consists of a number of animated bubbles floating through space. At the core is a relatively simple JavaScript physics engine. On every animation frame, about 60 times per second, the physics engine recalculates the positions of all bubbles, adjusts the speed of each bubble by applying gravity, and computes collisions. All these computations involve intensive floating point math. Each bubble is represented on screen by a DOM image element to which a CSS transform is applied. The image is first translated around its origin, and then scaled dynamically to produce the effect of the bubble inflating. In JavaScript, every bubble is represented as an object with accessor properties, as introduced in ECMAScript 5.</p>\r\n<p>Behind the floating bubbles is a large image, which starts off occluded by a fully opaque mask rendered in a &lt;canvas&gt; element. Whenever two bubbles collide, a portion of the occluding mask is removed by applying a Gaussian filter to the mask&rsquo;s opacity component to produce a diffuse transparency effect. This process also involves many floating point multiplications, which are performed on elements of <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/12/01/working-with-binary-data-using-typed-arrays.aspx\"> Typed Arrays</a>, if supported by the browser.</p>\r\n<p>Over the floating bubbles rests a touch surface, which responds to touch input if supported by the running browser or mouse events if not. In response to touch simulated magnetic repulsion is applied to the floating bubbles scattering them around.</p>\r\n<h2>Efficient Animation</h2>\r\n<p>In IE10 we introduced support for the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-animation-timing-20110602/\">requestAnimationFrame</a> API. When building JavaScript applications with animation we continue to recommend using this API (instead of setTimeout or setInterval) on browsers that support it. As discussed in a <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/07/05/using-pc-hardware-more-efficiently-in-html5-new-web-performance-apis-part-1.aspx\"> previous post</a> exploring how to make the most of your hardware, this API allows you to achieve maximum frame rate supported by the available display while avoiding excessive work that would remain invisible to the user. By doing the minimal number of operations to deliver the best user experience, you can save battery power. IE10 Release Preview <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2012/06/06/moving-the-stable-web-forward-in-ie10-release-preview.aspx\">supports this API</a> without vendor prefix, but the prefixed version is also maintained for compatibility with earlier IE10 preview releases. The Bubbles demo uses this API and falls back to setTimeout when it is not available.</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>Demo.prototype.requestAnimationFrame = <span style=\"color: blue;\">function</span> () {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">var</span> that = <span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">if</span> (window.requestAnimationFrame)</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.animationFrameTimer =</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 10em;\"><code>window.requestAnimationFrame(<span style=\"color: blue;\">function</span> () { that.onAnimationFrame(); });</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">else</span></code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.animationFrameTimer =</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 10em;\"><code>setTimeout(<span style=\"color: blue;\">function</span> () { that.onAnimationFrame(); }, <span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.animationFrameDuration);</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 2em;\"><code>&nbsp;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>Demo.prototype.cancelAnimationFrame = <span style=\"color: blue;\">function</span> () {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">if</span> (window.cancelAnimationFrame)</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><code>window.cancelAnimationFrame(<span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.animationFrameTimer);</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">else</span></code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><code>clearTimeout(<span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.animationFrameTimer);</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2>Converting DOM Values from Strings to Numbers</h2>\r\n<p>JavaScript is very flexible and includes a range of automatic conversions between values of different types. For example, string values are automatically converted to number values when used in arithmetic operations. In modern browsers, this convenience may come at a surprisingly high performance cost. Type specialized code emitted by state-of-the-art JavaScript compilers is very efficient in arithmetic on values of known types, but incurs very high overhead when it encounters values of unexpected types.</p>\r\n<p>When the Bubbles demo is loaded, the <code>numberOfBubbles</code> property starts off with a value of 100. On every animation frame, the position of each bubble is adjusted:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">function</span> Demo() {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.numberOfBubbles = 100;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: #006400;\">//...</span></code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 2em;\"><code>&nbsp;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>Demo.prototype.moveBubbles = <span style=\"color: blue;\">function</span>(elapsedTime) {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">for</span> (<span style=\"color: blue;\">var</span> i = 0; i &lt; <span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.numberOfBubbles; i++) {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.bubbles[i].move(elapsedTime, <span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.gravity);</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>When the user selects a different value in the UI, the value of the <code>numberOfBubbles</code> property must be adjusted accordingly. A straightforward event handler may do it like this:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>Demo.prototype.onNumberOfBubblesChange = <span style=\"color: blue;\">function</span> () {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.numberOfBubbles = document.getElementById(<span style=\"color: maroon;\">\"numberOfBubblesSelector\"</span>).value;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: #006400;\">//...</span></code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>This seemingly natural way of reading the user&rsquo;s input results in about 10% overhead in the JavaScript portion of the demo. Because the value obtained from the drop down and assigned to <code>numberOfBubbles</code> is a string (not a number), it has to be converted to a number on every iteration of the <code>moveBubbles</code> loop for every frame of the animation.</p>\r\n<p>This demonstrates that it&rsquo;s a good practice to explicitly convert values extracted from the DOM to numbers <i>before</i> using them in arithmetic operations. Values of DOM properties are typically of type string in JavaScript and the automatic string to number conversions can be quite expensive when done repeatedly. A better way to update <code>numberOfBubbles</code> based on user selection, as found in the demo, is as follows:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>Demo.prototype.onNumberOfBubblesChange = <span style=\"color: blue;\">function</span> () {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.numberOfBubbles = parseInt(document.getElementById(<span style=\"color: maroon;\">\"numberOfBubblesSelector\"</span>).value);</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: #006400;\">//...</span></code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2>Working with ES5 Accessor Properties</h2>\r\n<p>ECMAScript 5 accessor properties are a convenient mechanism for data encapsulation, computed properties, data validation, or change notification. In the Bubbles demo, whenever a bubble is inflated the radius is adjusted, which sets the computed <code>radiusChanged</code> property to indicate that the bubble&rsquo;s image needs to be resized.</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>Object.defineProperties(Bubble.prototype, {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: #006400;\">//...</span></code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code>radius: {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><code>get: <span style=\"color: blue;\">function</span> () {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 10em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">return</span> <span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.mRadius;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><code>},</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><code>set: <span style=\"color: blue;\">function</span> (value) {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 10em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">if</span> (<span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.mRadius != value) {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 12em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.mRadius = value;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 12em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.mRadiusChanged = <span style=\"color: blue;\">true</span>;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 10em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code>},</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: #006400;\">//...</span></code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>});</code></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>In all browsers, accessor properties add overhead as compared to data properties. The precise amount of overhead varies between browsers.</p>\r\n<h2>Minimizing Access of the Canvas ImageData</h2>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s a well-established practice to minimize the number of calls to DOM in loops on the critical performance path. For example, if the Bubbles demo updated the location of every bubble by looking up the corresponding element in the document (as below), performance would be adversely affected.</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>Bubble.prototype.render = <span style=\"color: blue;\">function</span> () {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code>document.getElementById(<span style=\"color: maroon;\">\"bubble\"</span> + <span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.id).style.left = Math.round(<span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.x) + <span style=\"color: maroon;\">\"px\"</span>;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code>document.getElementById(<span style=\"color: maroon;\">\"bubble\"</span> + <span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.id).style.top = Math.round(<span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.y) + <span style=\"color: maroon;\">\"px\"</span>;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.updateScale();</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Instead, the element corresponding to each bubble is cached in the bubble object in JavaScript once, and then accessed directly on every animation frame.</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>Bubble.prototype.render = <span style=\"color: blue;\">function</span> () {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.element.style.left = Math.round(<span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.x) + <span style=\"color: maroon;\">\"px\"</span>;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.element.style.top = Math.round(<span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.y) + <span style=\"color: maroon;\">\"px\"</span>;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.updateScale();</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>What may be less clear is that care must be taken to avoid similar overhead when working with &lt;canvas&gt;. The object obtained by calling <code>canvas.getContext(\"2D\").getImageData()</code> is <i>also</i> a DOM object. The code below could be used in the demo to draw the bubble collision effect to the canvas. In this version <code>imgData.data</code> is read on every iteration of the loop, which requires a call to the DOM and adds great overhead.</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>BubbleTank.prototype.renderCollisionEffectToCanvas = <span style=\"color: blue;\">function</span>(px, py) {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">var</span> imgData = <span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.canvasContext.getImageData(<span style=\"color: #006400;\">/*...*/</span>)</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: #006400;\">//...</span></code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">for</span> (<span style=\"color: blue;\">var</span> my = myMin; my &lt;= myMax; my++) {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">for</span> (<span style=\"color: blue;\">var</span> mx = mxMin; mx &lt;= mxMax; mx++) {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 10em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">var</span> i = (mx + gaussianMaskRadius) + (my + gaussianMaskRadius) * gaussianMaskSize;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 10em;\"><code>imgData.data[4 * i + 3] = 255 * occlusionMask[(px + mx) + (py + my) * canvasWidth];</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.canvasContext.putImageData(imgData, px - gaussianMaskRadius, py - gaussianMaskRadius);</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>A better way to update the &lt;canvas&gt; image data is by caching the <code>data</code> property as in the following code snippet.

When working with floating point numbers it is advantageous to use Typed Arrays (Float32Array or Float64Array) instead of JavaScript arrays (Array). JavaScript arrays can hold elements of any type, but typically require that floating point values be allocated on the heap (boxing) before being added to the array. This affects performance. To achieve consistently high performance on modern browsers use Float32Array or Float64Array to indicate the intent of storing floating point values. Doing so you help the JavaScript engine avoid heap boxing and turn on other compiler optimizations, like generating type specialized operations.</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>BubbleTank.prototype.generateOcclusionMask = <span style=\"color: blue;\">function</span>() {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">if</span> (<span style=\"color: blue;\">typeof</span> Float64Array != <span style=\"color: maroon;\">\"undefined\"</span>) {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.occlusionMask = <span style=\"color: blue;\">new</span> Float64Array(<span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.canvasWidth * <span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.canvasHeight);</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code>} <span style=\"color: blue;\">else</span> {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.occlusionMask = <span style=\"color: blue;\">new</span> Array(<span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.canvasWidth * <span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.canvasHeight);</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.resetOcclusionMask();</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>The example above shows how the Bubbles demo uses Float64Arrays to hold and update the occlusion mask applied to the canvas hiding the background image.

Windows 8 includes one HTML5 browsing engine that powers both browsing experiences (Metro style and desktop) as well as Metro\r\n\tstyle applications that use HTML5 and JavaScript. The release preview represents a major revision of the same modern JavaScript engine, Chakra, which first debuted\r\n\twith IE9. With each platform preview we make progress against our goals to create an engine that delivers great performance on the Web while ensuring that it is\r\n\thighly compatible, interoperable, and secure. This post will explore how the JavaScript engine has been enhanced to deliver great performance for emerging Web application\r\n\tscenarios.\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tPerformance for Real Web Applications</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWeb applications have been evolving rapidly in recent years. A decade ago the Web consisted primarily of Web sites with static content, like what you may encounter\r\n\tin a <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/\">blog</a>, a <a href=\"http://www.alwaysfreshgoodness.com/\">small</a> <a href=\"http://totokaelo.com/\">business</a> landing\r\n\tpage, or on <a href=\"http://www.wikipedia.org/\">Wikipedia</a>. The emergence of AJAX helped spawn more complex and interactive sites like what you see on <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com\">\r\n\t\tFacebook</a> or <a href=\"http://www.jetsetter.com/\">JetSetter</a>. Subsequent advances in performance allowed for large and complex applications to be created,\r\n\tsuch as <a href=\"http://1263974.r.msn.com/?ld=4vIua1S_hstxxIgu4bLH1zvR9AcSvkbb4f6awqeSajhpqnmwjBxg0ImvUDzhsPXYhsJh3LVIAsK-d88KVSxUu1Yv6DfWsQZPwKVZOu7teP0Z9SqYgFtcEdwXF7qtIbOxJ0qVAyJYIs_pYT7P7uMRjtp_ndnaUagsGPEH8vjEbYMwLkxOdV6D0ZoCF9ebr2rY7vq0KoXtN-UXu-306O2bzOCQ_bwRfG0CQe_2CAOx9a4QKogNmGQeKsUkfNw_l-GQ9s3xas5_c4bGTP62QRJgxOaf0bQQFmOrKkAr7K7zYPc66Q0TB7OApP1bh9T9s9LCpn37sJK4lSaA0GmgwYsk6qADqEl7CH2ArfnMsW1vEmAYg2O5lQQowjlUGMkCYBZkMVnlmQ59MLKAv9p4CemuE-ieoBtiMVmwZE4IgGVJAaawxjpspaj0xFuctgnuofHt69iZrWVmrUudjR5EDYMCPRSE9HTATFxpqP4qXI9AemDxqDxEJOVmMV4fKcb_vX-04UKKBcPBAmY3M95k4NcR4qGYx6yaSeuFaJVf4rEqYNjFjZtor7mTcP27U\">\r\n\t\tOffice 365</a>, <a href=\"http://maps.bing.com/\">Bing Maps</a>, etc. Most recently, the expansion of the W3C standard APIs, gains in JavaScript performance,\r\n\tand hardware accelerated graphics made building even sophisticated games on the Web possible, for example, <a href=\"http://chrome.angrybirds.com/\">Angry Birds</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pirateslovedaisies.com/\">Pirates Love Daisies</a>,\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.cuttherope.ie/\">Cut The Rope</a>, etc.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\">\r\n\t<img style=\"max-width: 95%;\" alt=\"Diagram showing spectrum of Web pages and their performance characteristics.

For traditional Web sites, initial page load determines how quickly the user can\r\n\tsee the content. Interactive Web sites and large Web applications may be gated by the efficiency of DOM operations, CSS processing, and manipulation of large internal\r\n\tstate in memory. HTML5 games often depend on fast canvas rendering, JavaScript execution and efficient garbage collection. In short, browser performance is a complex\r\n\tproblem, which requires taking into account the needs of a broad spectrum of diverse applications.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn this post we fill focus on performance of only one browser subsystem, the JavaScript engine. With recent gains in JavaScript performance, for many Web applications\r\n\tJavaScript execution is no longer a limiting factor. On the other hand, as performance increases, new scenarios emerge that place additional demands on the JavaScript\r\n\tengine. We continually look for opportunities to evolve Chakra to match performance requirements of real JavaScript-intensive applications.\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\">\r\n\t<img style=\"max-width: 95%; padding-bottom: 8px;\" alt=\"Two dimension chart showing screen shots of various sites plotted on two axis: Use of Other Browser Components (Y) and JavaScript Execution (X).

This involves deferring as much work as possible until absolutely necessary, avoiding\r\n\t\twork altogether, making use of periods of inactivity, and parallelizing work to minimize impact on the responsiveness of the application.<br />\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Take advantage of all available hardware. This translates to utilizing all available CPU cores, as well as generating advanced specialized CPU instructions, for example, \r\n\t\tIntel’s SSE2, if available.<br />\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\">\r\n\t<img style=\"max-width: 95%;\" alt=\"Diagram illustrating the Chakra JavaScript engine&#39;s use of two processor cores.\" src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/6232.aijpiiaw_2D00_image5_5F00_760x317.PNG\" /><br />\r\n\tChakra’s Parallel Architecture</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tChakra, though only one of the browser subsystems – is itself comprised of several components which work together to process and execute JavaScript code. When the\r\n\tbrowser downloads a JavaScript file it hands its content over to Chakra’s parser to verify its syntactical correctness. This is the only operation that applies\r\n\tto the entire file. Subsequent steps are performed individually on each function (including the global function). As a function is about to be executed (the global\r\n\tfunction is run immediately after parsing) Chakra’s parser builds an abstract syntax tree (AST) representation of the code, and hands it off to the bytecode generator,\r\n\twhich produces an intermediate form (bytecode) suitable for execution by the interpreter (but not directly by the CPU). Both the AST and the function bytecode are\r\n\tpreserved so they don’t need to be recreated on subsequent executions. The interpreter is then invoked to run the function. As the interpreter executes individual\r\n\toperations it collects information (a profile) about the types of inputs it encounters and keeps track of how many times the function was called.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAs the number of calls reaches certain threshold, the interpreter queues the function up for compilation. Unlike in other browsers, Chakra’s just-in-time (JIT)\r\n\tcompiler runs on a separate dedicated thread and thus does not interfere with script execution. The sole job of the compiler is to generate optimized machine instructions\r\n\tfor each function in the compilation queue. Once a function is compiled, the availability of the machine code is signaled to the main script thread. Upon the next\r\n\tinvocation, the entry point to the function is redirected to the newly compiled machine code and execution proceeds directly on the CPU. It’s important to note that\r\n\tfunctions that are called only once or twice never actually get compiled, which saves time and resources.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJavaScript is a managed runtime in that memory management is hidden from the developer and performed by an automatic garbage collector, which runs periodically\r\n\tto clean up any objects that are no longer in use. Chakra employs a conservative, quasi-generational, mark and sweep, garbage collector that does most of its work\r\n\tconcurrently on a dedicated thread to minimize script execution pauses that would interrupt the user experience.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis architecture allows Chakra to start executing JavaScript code almost immediately during page load. On the other hand, during periods of intense JavaScript\r\n\tactivity, Chakra can parallelize work and saturate up to three CPU cores by running script, compiling and collecting garbage at the same time.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tFast Page Load Time</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEven relatively static Web sites tend to use JavaScript for interactivity, advertising, or social sharing. In fact, the volume of JavaScript included in <a href=\"http://www.alexa.com/topsites\">\r\n\t\tAlexa’s top 1 million pages</a> has been steadily increasing, as reported by <a href=\"http://httparchive.org/index.php\">Steve Souders’ HTTP Archive</a>.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\">\r\n\t<img style=\"max-width: 95%; padding-bottom: 8px;\" alt=\"Chart showing volume of JavaScript in Alexa’s Top 1 Million Pages\" src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/5153.aijpiiaw_2D00_image6_5F00_598x295.png\" /><br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://httparchive.org/trends.php?s=All&amp;minlabel=Dec+28+2010&amp;maxlabel=May+15+2012#bytesJS&amp;reqJS\">Volume of JavaScript in Alexa’s Top 1 Million\r\n\t\tPages</a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe JavaScript code included in these Web sites must be processed by the browser’s JavaScript engine and the global function of each script file must be executed\r\n\tbefore the content can be fully rendered. Consequently, it is crucial that the amount of work performed on this critical path be minimized. Chakra’s parser and\r\n\tbytecode interpreter were designed with this objective in mind.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\r\n\t<b>Bytecode Interpreter.</b> JavaScript code executed during page load often performs initialization and setup that is executed only once. To minimize the overall\r\n\tpage load time it is imperative to start executing this code immediately – without waiting for a just-in-time compiler to process the code and emit machine instructions.\r\n\tThe interpreter starts running JavaScript code as soon as it is translated into bytecode. To further reduce the time to first executed instruction, Chakra processes\r\n\tand emits bytecode only for functions that are about to be executed using a mechanism called deferred parsing.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<b>Deferred Parsing.</b> <img style=\"padding: 8px 0 8px 12px; float: right;\" alt=\"Chart showing the fraction of code executed in 11 popular Web sites. The amount ranges from a little over 30% to a little over 50%.\"\r\n\t\tsrc=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/7416.aijpiiaw_2D00_image7_5F00_300x249.png\" />The <a href=\"http://www.research.microsoft.com/JSMeter\">JSMeter</a> project from Microsoft Research showed that typical Web pages use only a fraction\r\n\tof code that they download – generally on the order of 40-50% (see chart to right). Intuitively, this makes sense: developers often include popular JavaScript libraries like <a href=\"http://jquery.com/\">\r\n\t\tjQuery</a> or <a href=\"http://dojotoolkit.org/\">dojo</a> or custom ones like those used in Office 365, but only leverage a fraction of the functionality the\r\n\tlibrary supports.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo optimize such scenarios, Chakra performs only the most basic syntax-only parsing of the source code. The rest of the work (building the abstract syntax tree\r\n\tand generating bytecode) is performed one function at a time only when the function is about to be invoked. This strategy not only helps with the responsiveness\r\n\tof the browser when loading Web pages, but also reduces the memory footprint.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn IE9 there was one limitation of Chakra’s deferred parsing. Functions nested inside other functions had to be parsed immediately with their enclosing functions.\r\n\tThis restriction proved important because many JavaScript libraries employ the so called “<a href=\"http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/04/22/the-module-pattern-in-a-nutshell/\">module\r\n\t\tpattern</a>,” in which most of the library’s code is enclosed in a large function which is immediately executed. In IE10 we removed this restriction and Chakra\r\n\tnow defers parsing and bytecode generation of any function that is not immediately executed.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"clear:both;\">\r\n\tPerformance Improvements for JavaScript-Intensive Applications</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn IE10, as in IE9 before, we strive to improve the performance of real Web applications. However, Web applications depend on JavaScript performance to a varying\r\n\tdegree. To discuss the enhancements in IE10 it’s most useful to focus on those applications which are JavaScript-intensive; where improvements in Chakra yield substantial\r\n\tperformance gains. An important class of JavaScript-intensive applications includes HTML5 games and simulations.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAt the onset of IE10 we analyzed a sample of popular JavaScript games (for example, <a href=\"http://chrome.angrybirds.com/\">Angry Birds</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cuttherope.ie/\">\r\n\t\tCut the Rope</a>, or <a href=\"http://playtankworld.com/\">Tankworld</a>) and simulations (for example, <a href=\"http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Performance/FishIETank/Default.html\">\r\n\t\t\tFishIE Tank</a>, <a href=\"http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Performance/FishBowl/\">HTML5 Fish Bowl</a>, <a href=\"http://mrdoob.com/projects/chromeexperiments/ball_pool/\">\r\n\t\t\t\tBall Pool</a>, <a href=\"http://jarrodoverson.com/static/demos/particleSystem/\">Particle System</a>) to understand what performance improvements would\r\n\thave the most significant impact on the user experience. Our analysis revealed a number of common characteristics and coding patterns. All of the applications are driven\r\n\tby a high frequency timer callback. Most of them use canvas for rendering, but some rely on animating DOM elements, and some use a combination of the two. In most\r\n\tapplications at least portions of the code are written in the object oriented style – either in application code or in included libraries (for example, <a href=\"http://box2d-js.sourceforge.net/\">\r\n\t\tBox2d.js</a>). Short functions are common, as are frequent property reads and writes, and polymorphism. All of the applications perform floating point arithmetic\r\n\tand many allocate a fair amount of memory putting pressure on the garbage collector. These common patterns became the focus of our performance work in IE10. The\r\n\tfollowing sections describe the changes we’ve made in response.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tJust-in-Time Compiler – Reconsidered and Improved</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIE10 includes substantial improvements to Chakra’s JIT compiler. We added support for two additional processor architectures: x64 and ARM. That’s why, whether your\r\n\tJavaScript application is experienced by the user on a 64-bit PC or an ARM-based tablet, it enjoys the benefits of executing directly on the CPU.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe also changed the fundamental approach to generating machine code. JavaScript is a very dynamic language, which limits how much a compiler can know when generating\r\n\tcode. For example, when compiling the function below, the compiler doesn’t know the shape (property layout) of the objects involved or types of their properties.</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span> compute(v, w) {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">return</span> v.x + w.y;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn IE9 Chakra’s compiler generated code that located every property at runtime and handled all plausible operations (in the example above: integer addition, floating\r\n\tpoint addition, or even string concatenation). Some of these operations were handled directly in machine code, while others required help from Chakra’s runtime.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn IE10, the JIT compiler generates profile-based, type-specialized machine code. In other words, it generates machine code that is tailored to objects of a particular\r\n\tshape and values of a particular type. To emit the right code the compiler needs to know what types of input values to expect. Because JavaScript is a dynamic language,\r\n\tthis information is not available in the source code. We enhanced Chakra’s interpreter to collect it at runtime, a technique we call dynamic profiling. When a function\r\n\tis scheduled for JIT compilation, the compiler examines the runtime profile gathered by the interpreter and emits code tailored to the expected inputs.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The interpreter gathers information for the runs it observes, but it’s possible that the execution of the program will lead to runtime values which violate assumptions \r\n\tmade in the generated optimized code. For every assumption it makes, the compiler emits a runtime check.  If a later execution results in an unexpected value, the check \r\n\tfails, execution bails out of the specialized machine code, and is continued in the interpreter. The reason for bailout (the failed check) is recorded, additional profile \r\n\tinformation is collected by the interpreter, and the function is recompiled with different assumptions.  Bailout and re-compilation are two fundamentally new capabilities\r\n\tin IE10.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe net effect is that Chakra’s IE10 compiler generates fewer machine instructions for your code, reducing the overall memory footprint and speeding up execution.\r\n\tThis particularly impacts apps with floating point arithmetic and object property access, like the HTML5 games and simulations we previously discussed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIf you write JavaScript code in the object oriented style, your code will also benefit from Chakra’s support for function inlining. Object oriented code commonly\r\n\tcontains a large proportion of relatively small methods, for which the overhead of the function call is significant compared to the execution time of the function.\r\n\tFunction inlining allows Chakra to reduce this overhead, but more importantly it greatly expands the scope of other traditional compiler optimizations, such as\r\n\tloop invariant code motion or copy propagation.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tFaster Floating Point Arithmetic</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMost JavaScript programs perform some amount of integer arithmetic. As the example below illustrates, even in programs that don’t focus primarily on arithmetic,\r\n\tinteger values are commonly used as iteration variables in loops or as indices into arrays.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span> findString(s, a) {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">for</span> (<span style=\"color: Blue;\">var</span> i = 0, al = a.length; i &lt; al; i++) {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">if</span> (a[i] == s) <span style=\"color: Blue;\">return</span> i;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">return</span> -1;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFloating point math, on the other hand, is typically restricted to certain classes of applications such as games, simulations, sound, image or video processing,\r\n\tetc. Historically, few such applications were written in JavaScript, but recent advances in browser performance have made JavaScript implementations viable. In\r\n\tIE9 we optimized Chakra for the more common integer operations. In IE10 we dramatically improved floating point math.</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span> compute(a, b, c, d) {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">return</span> (a + b) * (c &#8722; d);</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGiven a simple function above a JavaScript compiler cannot determine the types of arguments a, b, c and d from the source code. The IE9 compiler would assume that\r\n\tthe arguments were likely to be integer numbers and generate fast integer machine instructions. This worked very well if during execution the arguments were, indeed,\r\n\tintegers. If floating point numbers were used instead, the code had to rely on much slower helper functions in Chakra’s runtime. The overhead of function calls\r\n\twas further exacerbated by boxing and unboxing of intermediate values on the heap (in most 32-bit JavaScript engines, including Chakra, individual floating point\r\n\tvalues must be allocated on the heap). In the expression above the result of each operation required a heap allocation, followed by storing the value on the heap,\r\n\tand then retrieval of the value from the heap for the next operation.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn IE10, the compiler takes advantage of the profile information collected by the interpreter to generate dramatically faster floating point code. In the example\r\n\tabove, if the profile indicates that all arguments are likely to be floating point numbers, the compiler will emit floating point machine instructions. The entire\r\n\texpression will be computed in just three machine instructions (assuming all arguments are already in registers), all intermediate values will be stored in registers,\r\n\tand only one heap allocation will be required to return the final result.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor floating point intensive applications this is a massive performance gain. Experiments show that in IE10 floating point operations execute about 50% faster than\r\n\tin IE9. In addition, the reduced rate of memory allocation means fewer garbage collections.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tFaster Objects and Property Access</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJavaScript objects are a convenient and broadly used mechanism for grouping logically related sets of values. Whether you’re using JavaScript objects in a structured\r\n\tobject oriented programming style or merely as flexible packaging for values, your code will greatly benefit from the improvements in object allocation and property\r\n\taccess performance added in IE10.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAs mentioned earlier, efficient property access is complicated in JavaScript because the shape of an object isn’t known during compilation. JavaScript objects can\r\n\tbe created ad hoc without a predefined type or class. New properties can be added to (or even removed from) objects on the fly and in any order. As a result, when\r\n\tcompiling the following method, the compiler doesn’t know where to find the values of properties x, y, and z on the Vector object.\r\n</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>Vector.prototype.magnitude = <span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span>() {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">return</span> Math.sqrt(<span style=\"color: Blue;\">this</span>.x * <span style=\"color: Blue;\">this</span>.x + <span style=\"color: Blue;\">this</span>.y * <span style=\"color: Blue;\">this</span>.y + <span style=\"color: Blue;\">this</span>.z * <span style=\"color: Blue;\">this</span>.z);</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn IE9 we introduced inline caches which greatly speed up access to properties. Inline caches remember the shape of the object and the location in the object’s\r\n\tmemory where a given property can be found. Inline caches can remember only one object shape and work well if all objects a function works with are of the same\r\n\tshape. In IE10 we added a secondary caching mechanism which improves performance of code operating on objects of different shapes (polymorphic).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBefore a property value can be read the compiler must verify that the object’s shape matches that stored in the inline cache. To do that, in IE9, the compiler\r\n\tgenerates a runtime shape check before every property access. Because programs often read or write multiple properties of the same object in close succession (as\r\n\tin the example below), all these checks add overhead.</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span> collide(b1, b2) {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">var</span> dx = b1.x - b2.x;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">var</span> dy = b1.y - b2.y;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">var</span> dvx = b1.vx - b2.vx;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">var</span> dvy = b1.vy - b2.vy;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">var</span> distanceSquare = (dx * dx + dy * dy) || 1.0;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">//...</span></code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn IE10, Chakra generates code tailored to the expected object shape. Through careful symbol tracking combined with bailout and re-compilation capabilities the\r\n\tnew compiler dramatically reduces the number of runtime shape checks performed. In the example above, instead of 8 separate shape checks, only 2 are done, one each\r\n\tfor b1 and b2. In addition, once the shape of an object has been established, all property locations are known, and read or write operations are as efficient as\r\n\tin C++.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn ECMAScript 5 objects may contain a new kind of properties, called accessor properties. Accessor properties differ from traditional data properties in that custom\r\n\tget and set functions are invoked to handle the read and write operations. Accessor properties are a convenient mechanism for adding data encapsulation, computed\r\n\tproperties, data validation, or change notification. Chakra’s internal type system and inline caches were designed to accommodate accessor properties and facilitate\r\n\tefficient reading and writing of their values.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIf you write an HTML5 game or animation, you often need a physics engine which performs computation required to produce realistic movement of objects under the\r\n\tforce of gravity, simulate collisions, etc. For very simple physics, you may build your own engine, but for a more complex requirements, you would typically use\r\n\tone of the popular physics libraries now available in JavaScript, such as <a href=\"http://box2d-js.sourceforge.net/\">Box2d.js</a> (ported from <a href=\"http://box2d.org/\">\r\n\t\tBox2d</a>). These libraries often use small objects, such as Point, Vector or Color. On every animation frame a large number of these objects are created and\r\n\tpromptly discarded. Therefore, it’s important that the JavaScript runtime create objects efficiently.\r\n</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">var</span> Vector = <span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span>(x, y, z) {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">this</span>.x = x;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">this</span>.y = y;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">this</span>.z = z;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 2em\"><code>&nbsp;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>Vector.prototype = {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">//...</span></code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code>normalize : <span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span>() {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">var</span> m = Math.sqrt((<span style=\"color: Blue;\">this</span>.x * <span style=\"color: Blue;\">this</span>.x) + (<span style=\"color: Blue;\">this</span>.y * <span style=\"color: Blue;\">this</span>.y) + (<span style=\"color: Blue;\">this</span>.z * <span style=\"color: Blue;\">this</span>.z));</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">return</span> <span style=\"color: Blue;\">new</span> Vector(<span style=\"color: Blue;\">this</span>.x / m, <span style=\"color: Blue;\">this</span>.y / m, <span style=\"color: Blue;\">this</span>.z / m);</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code>},</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 2em\"><code>&nbsp;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code>add : <span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span>(v, w) {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">return</span> <span style=\"color: Blue;\">new</span> Vector(w.x + v.x, w.y + v.y, w.z + v.z);</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code>},</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 2em\"><code>&nbsp;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code>cross : <span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span>(v, w) {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">return</span> <span style=\"color: Blue;\">new</span> Vector(-v.z * w.y + v.y * w.z, v.z * w.x - v.x * w.z, -v.y * w.x + v.x * w.y);</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code>},</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">//...</span></code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn IE10, the internal layout of JavaScript objects is optimized to streamline object creation. In IE9 every object consisted of a fixed-size header and an expandable\r\n\tproperty array. The latter is necessary to accommodate additional properties that may be added after the object has been created. Not all JavaScript applications\r\n\texploit this flexibility, and objects often receive most of their properties at construction. This trait allows Chakra to allocate most of the properties for such\r\n\tobjects directly with the header, which results in only one memory allocation (instead of two) for every newly created object. This change also reduces the number\r\n\tof memory dereferences required to read or write the object’s property, and improves register utilization. Improved object layout and fewer runtime shape checks\r\n\tresult in up to 50% faster property access.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tGarbage Collection Enhancements</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAs discussed above, HTML5 games and animations often create and discard objects at a very high rate. JavaScript programs don’t explicitly destroy discarded objects\r\n\tand reclaim memory. Instead, they rely on the engine’s garbage collector to periodically reclaim memory occupied by unused objects to make room for new ones. Automatic\r\n\tgarbage collection makes programming easier, but typically requires JavaScript execution to pause every now and then for the collector to do its work. If the collector\r\n\ttakes a long time to run, the whole browser may become unresponsive. In HTML5 games, even short pauses (tens of milliseconds) are disruptive because they are perceptible\r\n\tby the user as glitches in animation.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn IE10 we made a number of enhancements to our memory allocator and garbage collector. We already discussed object layout changes and generation of machine code\r\n\tspecialized for floating point arithmetic, which result in fewer memory allocations. In addition, Chakra now allocates leaf objects (for example, numbers and strings) from\r\n\ta separate memory space. Leaf objects don’t hold pointers to other objects, so they don’t require as much attention during garbage collection as regular objects.\r\n\tAllocating leaf objects from a separate space has two advantages. First, this entire space can be skipped during the mark phase, which reduces its duration. Second,\r\n\tduring concurrent collection, new allocations from the leaf object space don’t require rescanning affected pages. Because Chakra’s collector works concurrently\r\n\twith the main script thread, the running script may modify or create new objects on pages that have already been processed. To make sure such objects aren’t prematurely\r\n\tcollected, Chakra write-protects pages before the mark phase starts. Pages that have been written to during the mark phase must be later rescanned on the main script\r\n\tthread. Because leaf objects don’t require such processing, pages from the leaf object space don’t need to be write-protected or rescanned later. This saves precious\r\n\ttime on the main script thread, reducing pauses. HTML5 games and animations benefit significantly from this change, because they often work heavily with floating point\r\n\tnumbers and devote much of the allocated memory to heap-boxed numbers.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen the user interacts directly with a Web application, it is critical that the application’s code be executed as fast as possible, ideally without interruptions\r\n\tfor garbage collection. However, when the user switches away from the browser, or even just changes tabs, it is important to reduce the memory footprint of the\r\n\tnow inactive site or application. That’s why in IE9 Chakra triggered collection upon exiting JavaScript code if enough memory has been allocated. This worked well\r\n\tfor most applications, but proved problematic for applications driven by high frequency timers, such as HTML5 games and animations. For such applications collections\r\n\twere triggered too frequently and resulted in dropped frames and overall degradation of the user experience. Perhaps the most apparent manifestation of this problem\r\n\twas the <a href=\"http://www.playtankworld.com/\">Tankworld</a> game, but other HTML5 simulations also exhibited pauses in animation induced by frequent garbage collections.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn IE10 we solved this problem by coordinating garbage collections with the rest of the browser. Chakra now delays the garbage collection at the end of script execution\r\n\tand requests a callback from the browser after an interval of script inactivity. If the interval elapses before any script executes, Chakra starts a collection,\r\n\totherwise collection is further postponed. This technique permits us to shrink memory footprint when the browser (or one of its tabs) becomes inactive, while at\r\n\tthe same time greatly reducing frequency of collections in animation-driven applications.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCombined, these changes reduced the time spent in garbage collection on the main thread by an average factor of four on the HTML5 simulations measured. As a proportion\r\n\tof JavaScript execution time, garbage collection dropped from around 27% to about 6%.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tSummary\r\n</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIE10 achieves dramatic performance gains for JavaScript-intensive applications, particularly HTML5 games and simulations. These gains were accomplished through\r\n\ta range of important improvements in Chakra: from new fundamental capabilities of the JIT compiler to changes in the garbage collector.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAs we wrap up development on IE10 we celebrate the progress we’ve made, but we are keenly aware that performance is a perpetual quest. New applications emerge almost\r\n\tdaily that test the limits of modern browsers and their JavaScript engines. Without a doubt there will be plenty to work on in the next release!</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIf you’re a JavaScript developer, we’d love to hear from you. If the new capabilities and performance advances in IE10 helped you create entirely new experiences\r\n\tfor your users, or make existing applications better, please, let us know. If you’ve hit any performance limitations in IE, please, drop us a note as well. We carefully\r\n\tread all the comments on this blog, and we strive to make IE10 and Windows 8 the most comprehensive and performant application platform available.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t—Andrew Miadowicz, Program Manager, JavaScript</p>\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div><img src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=10319572\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">"

71371db6-824f-89d9-386e-104a7a65e070.description	"<p style=\"margin-bottom:0;\">As part of Windows 8 Release Preview planning, we reviewed <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh673549(v=vs.85).aspx\">all the W3C draft standards</a> supported by IE10. In particular, we looked for those specifications that:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"margin-top:0;\">\r\n<li>Are stable, that is, there were no recent additions or changes and no renaming or major changes are expected;</li>\r\n<li>Are supported by at least two browsers other than IE10;</li>\r\n<li>Are interoperable across all these browsers for the features’ core use cases;</li>\r\n<li>Are already used on the Web, including in their unprefixed form; and</li>\r\n<li>Reached Candidate Recommendation since Windows 8 Consumer Preview or are likely to become Candidate Recommendations in 2012.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:0;\">The following W3C draft standard features match these criteria and <b><i>IE10 now supports them in their unprefixed form</i></b>:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"margin-top:0;\">\r\n<li>Gradients (<a href=\"http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-images/#gradients\">CSS Image Values and Replaced Content</a>)</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-animations/\">CSS Animations</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-transitions/\">CSS Transitions</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-transforms/\">CSS Transforms</a></li>\r\n<li><code>font-feature-settings</code> property (<a href=\"http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-fonts/\">CSS Fonts</a>)</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/\">Indexed Database API</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/animation-timing/\">Timing control for script-based animations</a> (requestAnimationFrame)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>For compatibility with sites and apps developed using the Windows 8 Consumer Preview, IE10 <i>also</i> supports these standards in their vendor-prefixed form using the Microsoft vendor prefixes (<code>&#8209;ms&#8209;/ms</code>).</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:0;\">IE10 also supports the following W3C draft standards in vendor-prefixed form. We believe these drafts do not yet meet the criteria listed above:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"margin-top:0;\">\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-flexbox/\">CSS Flexible Box Layout</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-grid-layout/\">CSS Grid Layout</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-regions/\">CSS Regions</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-exclusions/\">CSS Exclusions and Shapes</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css-device-adapt/\">CSS Device Adaptation</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>From Experimental to Stable</h2>\r\n<p>When Web browsers implement emerging standards they do so by marking the new features with their own vendor prefix: a style property prefixed with <code>&#8209;moz&#8209;</code> indicates an experimental CSS feature in Mozilla's Firefox, <code>&#8209;ms&#8209;</code> means the same for Microsoft’s Internet Explorer, <code>&#8209;o&#8209;</code> for Opera, and <code>&#8209;webkit&#8209;</code> for WebKit-based browsers including Google’s Chrome and Apple’s Safari. The features’ object model equivalents are similarly prefixed.</p>\r\n<p>New platform APIs such as <code style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">window.requestAnimationFrame()</code> are likewise currently invoked as <code style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">window.mozRequestAnimationFrame()</code>, <code style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">window.webkitRequestAnimationFrame()</code>, or <code style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">window.msRequestAnimationFrame()</code>.</p>\r\n<p>Browser vendors generally drop their prefix once the corresponding specification reaches the Candidate Recommendation stage. This naming convention has a number of objectives, among which:  </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><b>Allow the specification to evolve:</b> without prefixes web content written for the earliest implementation(s) could constrain the editor(s) and make useful additions or changes difficult or even impossible, and</li>\r\n<li><b>Segregate experimental implementations:</b> the bugs or choice of draft version of a particular browser have no impact on other browsers. </li>\r\n<li><b>Style sheet documentation:</b> the vendor-specific dependencies of a style sheet are explicitly documented</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Other standards may not rely on vendor prefixes at all. For instance, browser vendors never prefixed the new HTML elements introduced by the HTML5 specification such as &lt;canvas&gt; and &lt;video&gt;. </p>\r\n<h2>The Web’s Best Practices </h2>\r\n<p>In practice, there comes a time when several browsers support the same draft feature in an interoperable manner. As a result, Web developers find themselves writing declarations such as:</p>\r\n<code style=\"display: block; font-family: Consolas, Monospace; font-size: 13px; color: Black; text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\"><div style=\"background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Red;\">-webkit-transform</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">rotate(30deg)</span>;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Red;\">-moz-transform</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">rotate(30deg)</span>;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Red;\">-ms-transform</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">rotate(30deg)</span>;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Red;\">-o-transform</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">rotate(30deg)</span>;</p>\r\n</div></code>\r\n<p>After copy and pasting this pattern a number of times, many developers assume the forthcoming W3C standard will be backward compatible with today’s Web. They proceed to “future-proof” their style sheets by adding an unprefixed version of the property:</p>\r\n<code style=\"display: block; font-family: Consolas, Monospace; font-size: 13px; color: Black; text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\"><div style=\"background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Red;\">-webkit-transform</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">rotate(30deg)</span>;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Red;\">-moz-transform</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">rotate(30deg)</span>;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Red;\">-ms-transform</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">rotate(30deg)</span>;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Red;\">-o-transform</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">rotate(30deg)</span>;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Red;\">transform</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">rotate(30deg)</span>;</p>\r\n</div></code>\r\n<p>From a web developer’s point of view, the above set of declarations is now ready for future browsers that support unprefixed CSS Transforms.</p>\r\n<p>Past standard features have in fact validated this pragmatic assumption. When IE9 added support for the unprefixed <code>border-radius</code> property in its first Platform Preview, our team saw the feature “light up” across many sites due to the future-proofed style sheets already deployed.</p>\r\n<p>A number of features are going through the same evolution now. Not only are many CSS Transitions demo pages already future proofed – see <a href=\"http://www.paulrhayes.com/experiments/parallax/#experiment\">Paul Hayes’ parallax effect</a> or <a href=\"http://leaverou.github.com/animatable/\">Lea Verou’s animatable gallery</a> – but open source projects such as <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/html5slides/\">Google’s html5slides</a>, <a href=\"http://davegamache.com/\">designers’ home pages</a>, <a href=\"http://www.impressivewebs.com/animating-css3-gradients/\">site logos</a> and <a href=\"http://www.impressivewebs.com/subtleties-css3-transitions/\">tutorials</a> routinely include unprefixed <code>transition</code> declarations. </p>\r\n<p>Many transition effects involve CSS Transforms, <a href=\"http://blog.typekit.com/2011/01/25/case-study-getting-hardboiled-with-css3-2d-transforms/\">tutorials</a> for which also frequently declare unprefixed <code>transform</code> properties. </p>\r\n<h2>Finishing the Specs</h2>\r\n<p>Even as Web developers anticipate browser convergence in their new markup, the standardization process is far more conservative. While <code>border-radius</code> worked interoperably enough for thousands of Web sites, members of the CSS Working Group were busy defining the rendering of more complex cases such as the appearance of a rounded corner between two adjacent borders of variable widths and colors. Likewise, the CSS <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transitions/\">Transitions</a>, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-animations/\">Animations</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transforms/\">Transforms</a> editors are working to <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=16806\">specify error conditions</a>, <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=14784\">fix errors</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=14658\">clarify less common scenarios</a>. </p> \r\n<p>While these issues must be resolved to ensure a high level of interoperability and to reach Recommendation status, relatively few of them will affect current and future content. Once a specification is stable and interoperable the web should not be held back by the last corner cases. This was not necessary for new HTML5 elements or to finalize the CSS2.1 spec, neither of which required prefixing. </p>\r\n<p>While solid specifications backed up by complete public test suites are critical, requiring all Web developers to repeat the same declarations multiple times until a Candidate Recommendation is published prioritizes spec completeness over content stability.</p>\r\n<p>Finishing a specification is a time-consuming effort. To take one example, CSS gradients <a href=\"http://www.webkit.org/blog/175/introducing-css-gradients/\">emerged in 2008</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/WD-css3-images-20090723/\">first Working Draft specifying an interoperable</a> solution in 2009 and the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-images/\">Candidate Recommendation was published  in April 2012</a>. In the meantime, the standardized syntax became incompatible with the prefixed syntax deployed on many Web sites. The Release Preview of IE10 is the first public unprefixed implementation of the latest spec. (IE10 also supports the more interoperable prefixed version with the <code>&#8209;ms&#8209;</code> vendor prefix.)</p>\r\n<h2>What It Means For Your Code</h2>\r\n<h3>CSS gradients</h3>\r\n<p>While broadly interoperable, the prefixed gradient syntax supported by all modern browsers reflects a now obsolete draft version of the specification. This earlier syntax is incompatible with the current Candidate Recommendation. For example, if you have declared the following gradient:</p>\r\n<code style=\"display: block; font-family: Consolas, Monospace; font-size: 13px; color: Black; text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\"><div style=\"background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">background: -ms-linear-gradient(left, yellow, red);</p></div></code>\r\n<p>Then producing the unprefixed equivalent is not simply a matter of removing the <code>&#8209;ms&#8209;</code> prefix. Because IE10's unprefixed linear gradient function conforms to the latest specification, it should become:</p>\r\n<code style=\"display: block; font-family: Consolas, Monospace; font-size: 13px; color: Black; text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\"><div style=\"background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">background: linear-gradient(to right, yellow, red);</p></div></code>\r\n<p>A future blog post will cover IE10’s support for CSS gradients in more detail.</p>\r\n<h3>Cascading and the CSS Object Model</h3>\r\n<p>The cascade will resolve prefixed CSS properties as expected; given the following rule (notice the higher rotation angle in the unprefixed declaration):</p>\r\n<code style=\"display: block; font-family: Consolas, Monospace; font-size: 13px; color: Black; text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\"><div style=\"background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">-ms-transform:</span> <span style=\"color: Maroon;\">rotate(30deg);</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">transform:</span> <span style=\"color: Maroon;\">rotate(60deg);</span></p>\r\n</div></code>\r\n<p>Your element will rotate 60 degrees: the two properties are treated as aliases of each other and the last declaration wins. Their corresponding CSSOM properties are also aliases: if you request the computed value of the <code>transform</code> and <code>msTransform</code> style properties they will both reflect the winning 60 degree transform. </p>\r\n<p>Likewise, setting <code>element.style.transform</code> will also set <code>element.style.msTransform</code> and vice-versa. </p>\r\n<h3>Serialization of property names</h3>\r\n<p>Properties such as <code>transition-property </code>take a list of CSS property names. For instance, to make the <code>transform</code> property transition over 2 seconds in IE10 Consumer Preview a developer would write:</p>\r\n<code style=\"display: block; font-family: Consolas, Monospace; font-size: 13px; color: Black; text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\"><div style=\"background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">-<span style=\"color: Maroon;\">ms-transition-property:</span> -<span style=\"color: Maroon;\">ms-transform;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">-<span style=\"color: Maroon;\">ms-transition-duration:</span> 2<span style=\"color: Maroon;\">s;</span></p>\r\n</div></code>\r\n<p>IE10 Release Preview will serialize the value of both <code>style.msTransitionProperty</code> and <code>style.transitionProperty</code> as ‘<code>transform</code>’. Note that the original prefix is not preserved. </p>\r\n<p>This is also true for the <code>propertyName</code> property of transition events.</p>\r\n<h3>Animation and Transition event type names</h3>\r\n<p>IE10 Release Preview allows the registration of Animation and Transition event listeners using both prefixed and unprefixed names i.e. the following are equivalent: </p>\r\n<code style=\"display: block; font-family: Consolas, Monospace; font-size: 13px; color: Black; text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\"><div style=\"background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">element.addEventListener(<span style=\"color: Maroon;\">&quot;MSTransitionEnd&quot;</span>, myHandler, <span style=\"color: Blue;\">false</span>);</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">element.addEventListener(<span style=\"color: Maroon;\">&quot;transitionend&quot;</span>, myHandler, <span style=\"color: Blue;\">false</span>);</p>\r\n</div></code>\r\n<p>But IE10 Release Preview will always return an unprefixed name in the <code>type</code> property of the event object.</p>\r\n<h2>What’s Next</h2>\r\n<p>We will submit new test cases to the W3C for all the features that IE10 now supports without a prefix. As Working Group members and co-editors, we will work with our colleagues to move these specifications forward to Candidate Recommendation.</p>\r\n<p>We welcome feedback you have on our support for these feature and their cross-browser compatibility.</p>\r\n<p>—Sylvain Galineau, Program Manager, Internet Explorer</p>\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div><img src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=10316058\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">"

The remainder of this post discusses the underlying HTML5 engine.</p>\r\n<p>Windows 8 includes one HTML5 browsing engine that powers both browsing experiences (the Metro style one and desktop one) as well as Metro style applications that use HTML5 and JavaScript. The common HTML5 engine provides consistently fast, safe, and powerful support for Web standards and the Web programming model, for both browser experiences as well as for Metro style applications.</p>\r\n<p>Consumers experience this power with responsive, touch-friendly pages that safely take full advantage of the underlying hardware. Some examples that you can try at the <a href=\"http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/\">IE Test Drive site</a> with the Consumer Preview include the Chalkboard Benchmark for common touch actions like panning and zooming and a multi-touch capable Web page for manipulating photos and images. You can read the full list in the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/gg192966\"> IE10 developer guide</a>.</p>\r\n<h3>Touch-friendly Adobe Flash in Metro style Internet Explorer 10</h3>\r\n<p>The Windows 8 Release Preview includes a new power-optimized, touch-friendly Adobe Flash Player. Adobe Flash content on compatible Web sites will now play in Metro style IE10. Metro style IE10 with Flash on Windows 8 enables people to see more of the Web working with high quality, especially compared with the experience in other touch-first or tablet experiences.</p>\r\n<p>We believe that having more sites &ldquo;just work&rdquo; in the Metro style browser improves the experience for consumers and businesses alike. As a practical matter, the primary device you walk around with should play the Web content on sites you rely on. Otherwise, the device is just a companion to a PC. Because some popular Web sites require Adobe Flash and do not offer HTML5 alternatives, Adobe and Microsoft worked together closely to deliver a Flash Player suitable for the Metro style experience.</p>\r\n<p>Both IE10 on the Windows desktop and Metro style IE use the same integrated Flash Player, with no need to download or install an additional player. IE10 on the desktop provides the same full Flash support as previous versions of IE that relied on the Flash Player plug-in, and continues to support other plug-ins. The Metro style browser continues to provide no support for other separate ActiveX controls or plug-ins.</p>\r\n<p>While any site can play Flash content in IE10 on the Windows desktop, only sites that are on the Compatibility View (<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/gg622935(v=vs.85).aspx\">CV</a>) list can play Flash content within Metro style IE. We place sites with Flash content on the CV list if doing so delivers the best user experience in Metro style IE with those sites. For example, how responsive is the content to touch? Does it work well with the onscreen keyboard, or affect battery life? Do visual prompts comply with the Metro style user experience guidelines? Sites that rely on capabilities (e.g. rollovers and P2P functionality) that are not supported within the Metro style experience, and don&rsquo;t degrade gracefully in their absence, are better off running in IE with Flash on the desktop. Site developers continue to control the content they serve to browsers. Developers can send HTML5 content to Metro style IE, or express their preference that Metro style IE prompt users to run their site on the desktop (see details <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2012/01/31/web-sites-and-a-plug-in-free-web.aspx\">here</a>).</p>\r\n<p>A good Flash Player experience is part of a no compromise experience across all form factors of PCs, including touch-centric PCs running Windows 8. We&rsquo;ve heard feedback from customers about their experience with sites that do not offer an HTML5 experience. For example, try pbskids.org on an iPad. Some workforce solutions, like <a href=\"https://www.beeline.com/\">Beeline</a>, require Flash. Some financial management sites, like <a href=\"https://www.benefitaccess.com/\">this one</a>, require Flash. And some sites still deliver their best experience with Flash, such as youtube.com.</p>\r\n<p>Adobe and Microsoft added support for touch gestures &ndash; like double tap and pinch to zoom &ndash; that work consistently across HTML5 and Flash. Adobe and Microsoft worked together to disable the desktop Flash functionality that is incompatible with touch, such as rollovers, within the Metro style experience. Much of Flash&rsquo;s other functionality works well with touch.</p>\r\n<p>Together we have also improved battery life with better support for <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2012/04/17/reclaiming-memory-from-metro-style-apps.aspx\"> PLM</a> in the Metro style experience. Flash on Windows has already supported offloading potentially battery-draining video work to specialized video hardware for some time (<a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/flashplayer/2011/03/adobe-supports-microsoft-ie-9.html\">link</a>). This work improves responsiveness and performance as well.</p>\r\n<p>Adobe and Microsoft have worked closely together for some time to address security and reliability issues (for example <a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/asset/2010/07/working-together.html\"> here</a>, and <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/sdl/archive/2009/06/17/microsoft-adobe-protecting-our-customers-together.aspx\">here</a>), sharing best practices like the <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/security/sdl\">SDL</a>/<a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/security/splc/\">SPLC</a> and ASLR as well as information on hangs and crashes. By updating Flash through Windows Update, like IE, we make security more convenient for customers. Microsoft and Adobe remain committed to meeting the expectations of Windows customers with regard to the delivery of security updates. We are also working together on accessibility, manageability, and privacy.</p>\r\n<p>The Flash Player included with Windows 8 is based on the full PC implementation and not a limited mobile subset, and there&rsquo;s a clear path to make it available on the new chip architectures that Windows 8 supports. Adobe is committed to delivering this same Flash Player support for Metro style IE on both x86/64 and the initial delivery of Windows RT PCs (Windows running on ARM processors).</p>\r\n<p>For the development community, platform continuity and technology choice are important. Flash in Metro style IE10 provides a bridge for existing sites to transition to HTML5 technologies where it makes sense and at a pace that is right for the experiences they want to deliver to their customers. HTML5 does not currently support, for example, some premium video content and game scenarios.</p>\r\n<p>We will provide additional technical information in the coming weeks through the regular documentation channels, like MSDN and <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/devnet.html\"> Adobe Developer Connection</a>. These details will include how developers can test Flash content on their own sites in Metro style IE, and how to submit their sites for consideration for the CV list. This documentation will also include a best practices guide to help developers, designers, and content publishers create experiences with Flash that plays well on Metro style IE. These best practices will complement existing recommendations on authoring touch-friendly HTML5 sites.</p>\r\n<h3>&ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; on By Default in IE in Windows 8</h3>\r\n<p>In Windows 8, IE10 sends a &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; signal to Web sites by default. Consumers can change this default setting if they choose. This decision reflects our commitment to providing Windows customers an experience that is &ldquo;private by default&rdquo; in an era when so much user data is collected online. IE10 is the first browser to send a &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; (DNT) signal by default.</p>\r\n<p>By changing the default Do Not Track setting in IE 10, we are broadening our commitment to providing consumers a great experience in Windows. And in the event companies don&rsquo;t respect the Do Not Track signal, IE 10 will continue to include Tracking Protection list support to help consumers block unwanted tracking with two clicks. While some people will say that this change is too much and others that it is not enough, we think it is progress and that consumers will favor products designed with their privacy in mind over products that are designed primarily to gather their data.</p>\r\n<p>You can read more about other actions underway with DNT <a href=\"http://blogs.technet.com/b/microsoft_on_the_issues/archive/2012/05/31/advancing-consumer-trust-and-privacy-internet-explorer-in-windows-8.aspx\"> here</a>.</p>\r\n<h3>Vendor prefixes, and moving the Web forward from experimental to stable</h3>\r\n<p>With the Release Preview of Windows 8, IE10 adds support for non-vendor prefixed versions of standards that have reached Candidate Recommendation (CR) status since the Windows 8 Consumer Preview or should reach CR in 2012.</p>\r\n<p>With this change, IE10 makes it easier for Web developers to write markup that works consistently across different browsers. Specifically, IE10 now supports the following W3C draft standards in their unprefixed form starting with the Release Preview: CSS transitions, transforms, animations, gradients, and CSS Fonts&rsquo; <code>font-feature-settings</code> property, as well as platform APIs such as the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/\">Indexed Database API</a> (<code>IndexedDB</code>) and <code>requestAnimationFrame()</code>.</p>\r\n<p>We selected these standards after examining <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh673549(v=vs.85).aspx\">all the W3C draft standards</a> IE10 supports and looking for standards that are stable (having no significant renaming or removal of properties/values expected), supported and interoperable across at least two browsers other than IE10 for the features&rsquo; core use cases, and already in use on the Web, including in their unprefixed form.</p>\r\n<p>Browser vendors generally drop the vendor prefix once a specification reaches CR. For compatibility with sites and apps developed using the Windows 8 Consumer Preview and that rely on the Microsoft vendor prefix, IE10 continues to support the <code style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">-ms-</code> vendor-prefixed forms as well. Note that IE10 continues to support only the vendor-prefixed form of several other standards because these specifications are not yet sufficiently stable and interoperable, for example <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-flexbox/\"> CSS Flexible Box Layout</a>.</p>\r\n<p>As a best practice, developers typically add an unprefixed version of a property to &ldquo;future-proof&rdquo; their pages. The following set of declarations is now ready for future browsers that support unprefixed CSS Transforms:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: red;\">-webkit-transform</span>: <span style=\"color: blue;\">rotate(30deg)</span>;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: red;\">-moz-transform</span>: <span style=\"color: blue;\">rotate(30deg)</span>;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: red;\">-ms-transform</span>: <span style=\"color: blue;\">rotate(30deg)</span>;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: red;\">-o-transform</span>: <span style=\"color: blue;\">rotate(30deg)</span>;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: red;\">transform</span>: <span style=\"color: blue;\">rotate(30deg)</span>;</code></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h3>Other Key Platform Changes</h3>\r\n<p>In the Release Preview, we continue to improve performance. Web pages should just &ldquo;stick to your finger&rdquo; and remain fast and fluid while panning, zooming, and scaling content. The Chalkboard Benchmark shows the results of some of our performance work. It measures how efficiently a browser can perform these common touch actions by zooming in and out of a &ldquo;chalkboard&rdquo; while panning left, right, up, and then down. IE10&rsquo;s performance here is a great example of Internet Explorer&rsquo;s hardware acceleration in action.</p>\r\n<p>Performance improvements contribute to great touch support, for example with full independent composition of Web page contents (fixed elements, subscrollers, animations, and video). We&rsquo;ve also improved performance on low-end hardware; intensive sites now show much less flashing and flickering on low-end hardware. These improvements make IE10&rsquo;s support for full screen video playback (in both HTML5 video and Adobe Flash Player) even better.</p>\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve continued to improve the performance of the Chakra JavaScript engine. JavaScript intensive Web applications, like HTML5 games, will benefit from dynamic profile-based JIT, type-specialized code generation for floating point numbers, expansion of function inlining, and further tuning to reduce the idle memory footprint while reducing the observable pauses due to garbage collection.</p>\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve also improved standards support in a number of ways. IE10 now has support for IVS/Emoji characters and the <code>classList</code> API and new <code>reverse</code> and <code>alternate-reverse</code> values of the <code>animation-direction</code> CSS property. DOM exceptions match the W3C WebIDL spec, and developers can use a constructor to create <code>Blob</code> objects, matching the W3C spec. We&rsquo;ve also removed legacy DX filters from all modes.</p>\r\n<p>HTML5 applications and sites can do more with touch via the <code>MSGesture</code> APIs that provide instantiable gesture event handling.</p>\r\n<h3>A Better Web Today, and Ahead</h3>\r\n<p>The opportunities continue for HTML5 to make both Web sites and applications better. Those opportunities are exciting for everyone on the Web.</p>\r\n<p>To get to that Web sooner, we continue to recommend that developers update old and out of date patterns on their sites. Looking at the CV list you can find examples of sites that need <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shim_(computing)\">shimming</a> because they use out of date libraries (e.g. <a href=\"http://Thetimes.co.uk\"> here</a>) or rely on browser detection rather than feature detection. The compatibility problem reports we receive have more to do with sites detecting IE and sending it different content than they send other browsers than any particular issue in IE. Developers can find sample feature detection code patterns in several IE blog posts, including <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/09/13/ie10pp3.aspx\">this one</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The quality and correctness of different browsers&rsquo; HTML5 engines continue to vary widely. We will submit updates to test cases to the W3C for all the features that IE10 now supports without a prefix. As members and co-editors of the CSS Working Group, we will work with our colleagues to move these specifications forward to Candidate Recommendation. We continue to contribute to the <a href=\"http://w3c-test.org/html/tests/reporting/report.htm\">test suites</a> under development at the HTML5 standards bodies to further the goal of interoperability and same markup. We&rsquo;ve submitted and updated over <a href=\"http://samples.msdn.microsoft.com/ietestcenter/\"> 240 tests</a> to them that you can view at the IE Test Center as well. As different browsers improve their support of the same markup to produce the same results, we can all realize the promise of HTML5.</p>\r\n<p>You can find a full list of new functionality available to developers in the IE10 developer guide <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/gg192966\">here</a>. Download the <a href=\"http://windows.microsoft.com/release-preview\">Windows 8 Release Preview</a> to try this update to IE10. We look forward to continued engagement with the developer community and your feedback on <a href=\"http://connect.microsoft.com/ie\">Connect</a>.</p>\r\n<p>&mdash;Dean Hachamovitch, Corporate Vice President, Internet Explorer</p><div style=\"clear:both;\"></div><img src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=10312869\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">"

ae9908a7-b721-0140-ef66-e6c5848ca9b5.description	"<p>Sharing a link to a Web page is a common activity on the PC, and it gets better with IE10 on Windows 8. One of the new features on Windows 8 is the Share charm, which allows you to seamlessly send content between apps on your PC. Previously, if you wanted to share an interesting article with your friend, or post a funny picture on your blog, you’d copy the link from the address bar, switch to a different site or app, and then paste it. Now, with the Windows 8 Share charm, you can share directly from the browser without ever leaving your current page.</p>\r\n<p>When you use the Share charm to share a site from the browser, IE10 creates two data formats that contain relevant content – the URI, and some HTML that includes a rich representation of the page. Here are two examples of data that get shared for a YouTube video:</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 0.25in;\">The URI (of the current site)</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><code>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DbgiOCTQts</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 0.25in;\">The HTML (with a link preview)</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\"><img style=\"max-width: 85%; padding: 12px; border: 1px solid #999; box-shadow: 3px 3px 8px 0px hsla(0, 0%, 0%, 0.25);\" alt=\"An example of IE10&#39;s rich preview of Web pages\" src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/2313.gysrfswi_2D00_gysrfswi_2D00_image1_2D00_1_5F00_521x115.png\" /><br />An example of IE10's rich preview of Web pages</p>\r\n<p>Both of these data formats are created for an “implicit” share, which is the name for what happens when you share the site that you are currently viewing. Since Web pages can be represented as hyperlinks or a rich HTML link preview, IE10 includes both types of data. Of course, if you aren’t sharing the whole page, but rather, some content that you’ve highlighted, IE10 will share the HTML of your selection instead of the URI and the link preview. In this case, sharing a selection would be called an “explicit” share, and does not include the link. This post describes the link sharing case, how IE10 participates in the Windows 8 Share contract using HTML, and how Web developers can create link previews with just a few meta-tags.</p>\r\n<h2>The Share Charm and IE10</h2>\r\n<p>Here’s a video of how a user might share links from the browser to an app that uses HTML.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\">\r\n    <iframe width='640' height='360' frameborder='0' src='http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/ieblog/common/videoframe.htm?mp4=http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-video/0511.SharingLinkPreviews_2800_Yelp_2900_.mp4'></iframe><br />\r\n               Sharing from IE10: Link Previews in Action</p>\r\n<p>In this video, “Stash” is a sample link saving app that makes use of the Windows share charm with HTML. The sample app simply supports the HTML data format for sharing, and IE provides the link preview. Link previews are HTML that contains a title, image, and description for every shared link. This makes it easy for you to recognize the site content. If you have <a href=\"http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/download\">Windows 8 Consumer Preview</a> and <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/11/en-us/downloads\">Visual Studio 11 Beta</a>, you can <a href=\"http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Browser/Windows8Share/DownloadDemoApp.html\" target=\"_blank\">download and run Stash</a> on your own PC. Stash integrates with the Windows 8 Share contract as a target app, as you can see below. Below, you can see a high-level diagram that shows how links are shared from IE10.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\"><img style=\"max-width: 95%; padding: 8px; border: 1px solid #999; box-shadow: 3px 3px 8px 0px hsla(0, 0%, 0%, 0.25);\" alt=\"Diagram showing sharing a link from IE10 to target apps, using the Share charm’s data package\" src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/7028.gysrfswi_2D00_image1_5F00_760x385.png\" /><br />Diagram: Sharing a link from IE10 to target apps, using the Share charm’s data package</p>\r\n<p>Windows 8 Share charm handles the coordination between the source and target apps to provide an integrated sharing experience across all apps. This removes the need for target and source apps to be aware and coordinate between each other. </p>\r\n<h2>Sharing the Web is Better, Start to Finish</h2>\r\n<p>The Web is made up of HTML. That’s why HTML is one of the most important data formats in IE10’s integration with the Share contract. IE10 creates link previews to both provide a better sharing experience for users, and to help connect Web developers to Windows 8 Share. With a little extra meta-data markup, sites can define what information is included in their link previews. On the other end of the share contract, target apps that support the HTML data format can get the full experience of contextual Web hyperlinks without having to parse a single site. The end result is a rich, modern, and fluid sharing experience, from end to end.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\"><img style=\"max-width: 95%; border: 1px solid #999; box-shadow: 3px 3px 8px 0px hsla(0, 0%, 0%, 0.25);\" alt=\"Screenshot of target apps available in Share pane\" src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/6840.gysrfswi_2D00_image2_5F00_760x475.png\" /><br />Screenshot of target apps available in Share pane</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\"><img style=\"max-width: 95%; border: 1px solid #999; box-shadow: 3px 3px 8px 0px hsla(0, 0%, 0%, 0.25);\" alt=\"Screenshot of Stash’s Share Pane\" src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/4885.gysrfswi_2D00_image3_5F00_760x475.png\" /><br />Screenshot of Stash’s Share Pane</p>\r\n<p>When you share a Web site, IE10 parses that site to create a link preview. In the example above, it’s a short snippet of content that represents a movie page on IMDb. The goal of sharing HTML, in addition to the URI, is to share the best possible representation of what the user intended to share, so IE10 creates link previews for all implicit shares. The benefits of HTML are that it can include more information than a URI, and the content of the HTML is more meaningful than a hyperlink. In the words of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Knope\">Leslie Knope</a>, no one wants to share that “complicated nonsense.”</p>\r\n<div style=\"position: relative; height: auto;\">\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\"><img style=\"max-width: 95%; border: 1px solid #999; box-shadow: 3px 3px 8px 0px hsla(0, 0%, 0%, 0.25);\" alt=\"Frame grab from the NBC show Parks and Recreation.

For example, blogging apps can take advantage of rich HTML content, and SMS apps would do best to use the URI. Developers of Metro style apps choose the data format(s) that make most sense for their app to receive, following the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh771179.aspx\">Windows 8 Share guidance</a>. </p>\r\n<h2>Sites Use Markup to Define What IE10 Shares</h2>\r\n<p>Since IE10 uses existing markup meant for sharing on the Web, many sites will already look great when sharing HTML link previews on Windows 8. We support the <a href=\"http://ogp.me/\">Open Graph protocol</a> as a simple way to add meta-data about the page. When users share sites on Facebook and through Windows 8 and IE10, you can use OpenGraph to control the way your Web page appears to others. </p>\r\n<p>Here’s an example of <a href=\"http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Performance/BrickBreaker/\" target=\"_blank\">an IE test drive demo</a> that uses this markup:</p>\r\n<code style=\"display: block; font-family: Consolas, Monospace; font-size: 13px; color: Black; text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\"><div style=\"background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">head</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">meta</span> <span style=\"color: Red;\">name</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">=&quot;description&quot;</span> <span style=\"color: Red;\">content</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">=&quot;Brick Breaker TestDrive Demo Game, Performance and Touch benchmark&quot;</span> <span style=\"color: Blue;\">/&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">title</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&gt;</span>Brick Breaker<span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;/</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">title</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">meta</span> <span style=\"color: Red;\">property</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">=&quot;og:image&quot;</span> <span style=\"color: Red;\">content</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">=&quot;Views/Homepage/Icons/BrickBreaker.png&quot;</span> <span style=\"color: Blue;\">/&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;/</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">head</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&gt;</span></p>\r\n</div></code>\r\n<p>IE looks for the following tags in the site’s markup to create the page’s link preview.</p>\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\r\n<tr><th>Property</th>\r\n<th>HTML tag</th>\r\n<th>Character limit</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr><td>Title 1</td>\r\n<td>&lt;meta name=\"title\" content=\"Insert Site Title Here” /&gt;</td>\r\n<td>160</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr><td>Title 2</td>\r\n<td>&lt;title&gt;Insert Site Title Here&lt;/title&gt;</td>\r\n<td>160</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr><td>Description</td>\r\n<td>&lt;meta name=\"description\" content=\"Insert Site Description Here” /&gt;</td>\r\n<td>253</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr><td>Image 1</td>\r\n<td>&lt;meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"insert_image_link_here\" /&gt;</td>\r\n<td>2,048 (limit for image URI)</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr><td>Image 2</td>\r\n<td>&lt;link rel=\"image_src\" href=\"insert_image_link_here\" /&gt;</td>\r\n<td>2,048 (limit for image URI)</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr><td>Image 3</td>\r\n<td>&lt;meta name=\"image\" content=\"insert_image_link_here\" /&gt;</td>\r\n<td>2,048 (limit for image URI)</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr><td>Image 4</td>\r\n<td>&lt;meta name=\"thumbnail\" content=\"insert_image_link_here\" /&gt;</td>\r\n<td>2,048 (limit for image URI)</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>Note that this is the order in which we parse for each attribute. For example, if both Image 1 and Image 2 tags are present, we’ll use the Image 1 tag. Additionally, if more than one tag of any type is present, we use the first one you list in your markup.</p>\r\n<p>For character limits, if the description is longer than the maximum length, IE will put a “…” at the end in the preview.</p>\r\n<p>Make sure to include at least one of each property in your site markup to get your pages looking great for sharing in Windows 8. See <a href=\"http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Browser/Windows8Share/\" target=\"_blank\">this demo on the IE Test Drive site</a> for more on how the markup works.</p>\r\n<h2>Apps Get the Benefit of a Powerful Web Browser</h2>\r\n<p>If your app supports the Share target app contract, you should consider whether it makes sense for it to support HTML as a shared data format. Apps that use HTML can benefit from the link previews shared by IE10 because IE10 does all of the heavy lifting. It parses the site and puts together a short and informative link preview, and all your app needs to do is display and host the HTML. The hyperlink is embedded within the preview, so it functions just like a Uri, but looks much better. This way, apps that don’t have the resources to parse the Web to condense pages into small, rich previews, can still display contextual links as HTML.  </p>\r\n<p>Many apps, in addition to IE10, will share HTML. Target apps that accept HTML must be agnostic about the source of the shared data. As noted above, IE10 shares HTML for both implicit and explicit sharing scenarios, so sometimes the HTML is a link preview, and sometimes it’s a user selection. In either case, the content of the HTML is the best possible representation of what the user intended to share. Here’s a snippet of what the link preview HTML generated by IE10 will look like when it’s added to the Share charm’s Data Package:</p>\r\n<code style=\"display: block; font-family: Consolas, Monospace; font-size: 13px; color: Black; text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\"><div style=\"background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">html</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">body</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">style</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">/* IE10</span>\\uc1\\u8217?s metro-style CSS attributes */</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;/</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">style</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">a</span> <span style=\"color: Red;\">class</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">=&quot;snippet-URL&quot;</span> <span style=\"color: Red;\">href</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">=&quot;http://site_link_goes_here&quot;&gt;</span>Website Title goes here<span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;/</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">a</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">table</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">tr</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 10em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">td</span> <span style=\"color: Red;\">class</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">=&quot;snippet-image&quot;&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 12em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">img</span> <span style=\"color: Red;\">src</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">=&quot;image_link_goes_here&quot;</span> <span style=\"color: Blue;\">/&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 10em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;/</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">td</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 10em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">td</span> <span style=\"color: Red;\">class</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">=&quot;snippet-text&quot;&gt;</span>Website description goes here <span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;/</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">td</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;/</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">tr</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;/</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">table</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">&lt;!--EndFragment--&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;/</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">body</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;/</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">html</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&gt;</span></p>\r\n</div></code>\r\n<p>For an example of an app that uses HTML from IE10, <a href=\"http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Browser/Windows8Share/DownloadDemoApp.html\" target=\"_blank\">download the sample app “Stash”</a> seen in the video above.

a8a2e21b-d3f6-68a6-8850-f696bc67e2a8.description	"<p>IE10 in <a href=\"http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/consumer-preview\">Windows 8 Consumer Preview</a> includes support for <code>Error.stack</code>, which enables Web developers to diagnose and correct bugs faster, especially those that are difficult to reproduce. Developers can build amazing apps with the capabilities of Web platforms that power today’s modern browsers. In Windows 8, we expose that power through both Internet Explorer 10 and <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/br211385.aspx\">Metro style apps in JavaScript</a>. The increasing power and complexity of these apps means developers need better tools like <code>Error.stack</code> for handling errors and diagnosing bugs. </p>\r\n<h2>Debugging Applications</h2>\r\n<p>Structured error handling in JavaScript rests on <code>throw</code> and <code>try/catch</code> – where the developer declares an error and passes the control flow to a portion of the program that deals with error handling. When an error is thrown, Chakra, the JavaScript engine in Internet Explorer, captures the chain of calls that led up to where the error originated – also referred to as the call stack. If the object being thrown is an <code>Error</code> (or is a function whose prototype chain leads back to <code>Error</code>), Chakra creates a stack trace, a human-readable listing of the call stack. This listing is represented as a property, <code>stack</code>, on the <code>Error</code> object. The <code>stack</code> includes the error message, function names, and source file location information of the functions. This information can help developers rapidly diagnose defects by learning what function was being called, and even see what line of code was at fault. For example, it might indicate that a parameter passed into the function was null or an invalid type.</p>\r\n<p>Let’s explore with an example of a simple script that attempts to calculate the distance between two points, <code>(0, 2)</code> and <code>(12, 10)</code>:</p>\r\n<code style=\"display: block; font-family: Consolas, Monospace; font-size: 13px; color: Black; text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\"><div style=\"background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">(<span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span> () {</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">&#39;use strict&#39;</span>;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span> squareRoot(n) {</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">if</span> (n &lt; 0)</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 10em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">throw</span> <span style=\"color: Blue;\">new</span> Error(<span style=\"color: Maroon;\">&#39;Cannot take square root of negative number.&#39;</span>);</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 2em\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">return</span> Math.sqrt(n);</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">}</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 2em\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span> square(n) {</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">return</span> n * n;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">}</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 2em\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span> pointDistance(pt1, pt2) {</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">return</span> squareRoot((pt1.x - pt2.x) + (pt1.y - pt2.y));</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">}</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 2em\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span> sample() {</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">var</span> pt1 = { x: 0, y: 2 };</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">var</span> pt2 = { x: 12, y: 10 };</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 2em\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\">console.log(<span style=\"color: Maroon;\">&#39;Distance is: &#39;</span> + pointDistance(pt1, pt2));</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">}</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 2em\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">try</span> {</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\">sample();</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">}</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">catch</span> (e) {</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\">console.log(e.stack);</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">}</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">})();</p>\r\n</div></code>\r\n<p>This script has a bug – it forgets to square the differences of the components. As a result, for some inputs, the <code>pointDistance</code> function will simply return incorrect results; other times, it will cause an error. To understand the stack trace, let’s examine the error in the F12 developer tools and look at its Script tab:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\"><img style=\"max-width: 95%; border: 1px solid #999; box-shadow: 3px 3px 8px 0px hsla(0, 0%, 0%, 0.25);\" alt=\"Screen shot of the F12 developer tools showing a stack trace logged by calling console.log(e.stack) where e is the Error object passed to the catch clause of a try/catch block.\" src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/8037.djewes_2D00_image1_5F00_760x421.png\" /></p>\r\n<p>The stack trace is dumped to the console in the <code>catch</code> clause, and because it’s at the top of the stack, it’s readily apparent that the Error is originating in the <code>squareRoot</code> function. To debug the problem, a developer wouldn’t have to go very deep into the stack trace; <code>squareRoot</code>’s precondition was violated, and looking one level up the stack, it’s clear why: the sub-expressions within the call to <code>squareRoot</code> should themselves be parameters to <code>square</code>. </p>\r\n<p>While debugging, the <code>stack</code> property can help identify code for setting a breakpoint. Bear in mind that there are other ways to view the call stack: for instance, if you set the script debugger to “Break on caught exception” mode, you may be able to inspect the call stack with the debugger. For deployed applications, you may consider wrapping problematic code within <code>try/catch</code> in order to capture failed calls, and log them to your server. Developers would then be able to look at the call stack to help isolate problem areas.</p>\r\n<h3>DOM Exceptions and Error.stack</h3>\r\n<p>I noted previously that the object being thrown must be an <code>Error</code> or lead back to <code>Error</code> via its prototype chain. This is intentional; JavaScript supports throwing any object and even primitives as exceptions. While all of these can be caught and examined, they are not all specifically designed to contain error or diagnostic information. As a consequence, only Errors will be updated with a <code>stack</code> property when thrown. </p>\r\n<p>Even though DOM Exceptions are objects, they don’t have prototype chains that lead back to <code>Error</code>, and therefore they don’t have a <code>stack</code> property. In scenarios in which you are performing DOM manipulation and want to surface JavaScript-compatible errors, you may want to wrap your DOM manipulation code within a <code>try/catch </code>block, and throw a new <code>Error</code> object within the <code>catch</code> clause:</p>\r\n<code style=\"display: block; font-family: Consolas, Monospace; font-size: 13px; color: Black; text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\"><div style=\"background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span> causesDomError() {</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">try</span> {</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">var</span> div = document.createElement(<span style=\"color: Maroon;\">&#39;div&#39;</span>);</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\">div.appendChild(div);</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">} <span style=\"color: Blue;\">catch</span> (e) {</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">throw</span> <span style=\"color: Blue;\">new</span> Error(e.toString());</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">}</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">}</p>\r\n</div></code>\r\n<p>However, you will probably want to consider whether you want to use this pattern. It is likely best-suited for utility library development; specifically, consider whether your code’s intent is to hide DOM manipulation, or to simply carry out a task. If it is hiding DOM manipulation, wrapping the manipulation and throwing an <code>Error</code> is probably the right way to go.</p>\r\n<h3>Performance Considerations</h3>\r\n<p>The construction of the stack trace begins when the error object is thrown; doing so requires walking the current execution stack. To prevent performance problems in traversing a particularly large stack (possibly even a recursive stack chain), by default, IE only collects the top 10 stack frames. This setting is configurable, however, by setting the static property <code>Error.stackTraceLimit</code> to another value. This setting is global, and must be changed <code>prior to throwing the error</code>, or else it will not have an effect on stack traces. </p>\r\n<h3>Asynchronous Exceptions</h3>\r\n<p>When a stack trace is generated from an asynchronous callback (for example, a <code>timeout</code>, <code>interval</code>, or <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>), the asynchronous callback, rather than the code that created the asynchronous callback, will be at the bottom of the call stack. This has some potential implications for tracking down offending code: if you use the same callback function for multiple asynchronous callbacks, you may find it difficult to determine by inspection alone which callback caused the error. Let’s slightly modify our previous sample so that, instead of calling <code>sample()</code> directly, we’ll put that into a timeout callback:</p>\r\n<code style=\"display: block; font-family: Consolas, Monospace; font-size: 13px; color: Black; text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\"><div style=\"background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">(<span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span> () {</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">&#39;use strict&#39;</span>;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span> squareRoot(n) {</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">if</span> (n &lt; 0)</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 10em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">throw</span> <span style=\"color: Blue;\">new</span> Error(<span style=\"color: Maroon;\">&#39;Cannot take square root of negative number.&#39;</span>);</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 2em\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">return</span> Math.sqrt(n);</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">}</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 2em\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span> square(n) {</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">return</span> n * n;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">}</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 2em\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span> pointDistance(pt1, pt2) {</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">return</span> squareRoot((pt1.x - pt2.x) + (pt1.y - pt2.y));</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">}</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 2em\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span> sample() {</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">var</span> pt1 = { x: 0, y: 2 };</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">var</span> pt2 = { x: 12, y: 10 };</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 2em\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\">console.log(<span style=\"color: Maroon;\">&#39;Distance is: &#39;</span> + pointDistance(pt1, pt2));</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">}</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 2em\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">setTimeout(<span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span> () {</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">try</span> {</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 10em;\">sample();</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\">}</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">catch</span> (e) {</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 10em;\">console.log(e.stack);</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\">}</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">}, 2500);</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">})();</p>\r\n</div></code>\r\n<p>Upon executing this snippet, you’ll see the stack trace come up after a slight delay. This time, you’ll also see that the bottom of the stack is not Global<code> </code>Code but rather is <code>Anonymous function</code>. In fact, it’s not the same anonymous function, but the callback function passed into <code>setTimeout</code>. Since you lose the context surrounding hooking up the callback, you may not be able to determine what is causing the callback to be called. If you consider a scenario in which one callback is registered to handle the <code>click</code> event of many different buttons, you will be unable to tell to which callback the registration refers to. That being said, this limitation is only minor, because, in most cases, the top of the stack will likely highlight the problem areas.</p>\r\n<h2>Exploring the Test Drive Demo</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\"><img style=\"max-width: 95%; border: 1px solid #999; box-shadow: 3px 3px 8px 0px hsla(0, 0%, 0%, 0.25);\" alt=\"Screen shot of Test Drive demo Explore Error.stack\" src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/2654.Test_2D00_Drive_2D00_Screen_2D00_Capture.png\" /></p>\r\n<p>Check out this <a href=\"http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/browser/ExploreErrorStack/\">Test Drive demo</a> using IE10 in the <a href=\"http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/consumer-preview\">Windows 8 Consumer Preview</a>.

d4c50861-198c-3d01-6b83-0c85e93b11b2.description	"<p>Today is Alan Turing&#8217;s 100th birthday. I&#8217;ve been thinking about him lately, in particular about a story that demonstrates the perils of working with genius.</p>\n<p>The story goes that, when Turing was working with the Manchester Baby (the first stored program computer ever built. Just) a colleague wrote the first ever assembler which would turn (relatively) human readable assembly language and turn it into the ones and zeroes of machine code that the machine could actually execute. He showed it to Turing, who blew up at him, ranting that using the computer to do &#8216;trivial&#8217; jobs like that were a massive waste of expensive computer time.</p>\n<p>The problem with working with a genius, from the point of view of more ordinary mortals, is that the genius has only a very rough idea of what is actually easy, and what is only easy to them. From today&#8217;s vantage point, when computers are as freely available as they are now, the idea of <em>not</em> letting the computer do the shitwork for you seems utterly ludicrous &#8211; programmer time is more valuable than computer time.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s less obvious is that the same was true in Turing&#8217;s time (when there was precisely one computer) too. It only takes one programmer to make a mistake in translating from assembler to machine code and run a job that, for instance, gets stuck in an infinite loop and you&#8217;ve probably wasted more computer time (and programmer time) than if you&#8217;d just run it through the assembler in the first place. Turing didn&#8217;t see that, because the process of translating from symbols to binary wasn&#8217;t something that he found particularly complicated. To him, what was needed wasn&#8217;t more and better tools, it was more and better Turings.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not entirely sure that I believe the story (and I can&#8217;t remember where I heard it, so it may be a phantom of my memory). It certainly doesn&#8217;t chime with the Turing who was instrumental in mechanising the shitwork of finding the days rotor settings so that Enigma traffic could be cracked. The history of Bletchley Park is a story of building better and better machines to do the dully repetitive jobs that humans find so hard to stick to and which machines excel at.</p>\n<p>The &#8220;Just write code without bugs in the first place&#8221; school of programming is alive and well today. It&#8217;s not my school though. I&#8217;m very much an exploratory coder. I like to have tests to show me the way and to keep me honest so that I don&#8217;t go breaking things when I change this bit here. I&#8217;ve customised my editing environment to help me as much as possible. I have a nasty habit of writing bare words that I should have quoted, so I have a keystroke that shoves the last word into quotes for me. Another keystroke will align all the broad arrows at the current level of nesting. I&#8217;ve got snippets set up that fill in standard boilerplate when I start a new class, a huge list of common spelling mistakes that get autocorrected while I&#8217;m not looking and an expanding list of other little helpers that I need to write when I get around to it. Automation lets me go faster, make more and better mistakes and recover from them faster. I am a of little brain and I want all the help I can give myself.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure that Turing would be in the same camp as me.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the thing though &#8211; Turing was, definitely, a genius. But his paper &#8220;On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem&#8221; (the one that gave the world the Turing Machine) has a bug in it. In fact, it has two. The first is obvious enough that I spotted it when i read the paper for the first time. The second bug is rather more subtle (but still fixable. It&#8217;s okay, the field of computing is not build on sand).</p>\n<p>I love that The Paper &#8211; The one that&#8217;s the theoretical basis for the modern world (first publishd 75 years ago, round(ish) number fans) &#8211; has a bug. It gives me a strange kind of hope. Fallibility gets us all &#8211; even people who have saved the world. I think we should celebrate the humanity as well as the genius. Turing was, by all accounts, a very odd fish, but the world is undeniably richer for his contributions.</p>\n<p>So, let&#8217;s raise a glass to the memory of Alan Turing tonight, marathon runner, gay icon, saviour of the world and the pleasantly fallible inventor of the modern world. Not a bad CV, when you think about it.</p>\n<h4>Updated</h4>\n<p>Apparently I&#8217;m wrong about it being Turing who didn&#8217;t like the assembler but Von Neumann (another genius). See below for details. And phew! How nice to find that a hero doesn&#8217;t have feet of clay.</p>"

It just so happened that <span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span> (Yet Another Perl Conference) was held in Asheville this year, the week before the gathering&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.swangathering.com/Catalog/TS/sgtssched.html\">Traditional Song Week</a>. Well, I&#8217;m a perl hacker. I sing traditional songs. My employer was paying for me to attend <span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span> and were willing for me to extend my stay in America by a week. It was a no brainer really.</p>\n<p><span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span> was bloody good this year. Perl 5 development is moving forward and the community is buzzing because of it. Lots of &#8220;… and we&#8217;re hiring&#8221; slides. And that&#8217;s before we get to the pleasure of catching up with friends that I only see online most of the time. If you&#8217;re working in any field that has grassroots conferences associated with it, I can&#8217;t recommend attending them highly enough.</p>\n<h3>On to Swannanoa</h3>\n<p>At Swannanoa, I met Sheila Kay Adams and immediately switched my schedule to spend as much time singing with her as possible. Sheila&#8217;s a seventh generation ballad singer from the Sodom Laurel community in Madison Count. Her &#8220;grannie Berzil&#8221; Wallin remembered Cecil Sharp coming to Madison County and collecting songs from the family.</p>\n<p>Pedigree in singing shouldn&#8217;t matter, but it turns out it does. Sheila grew up in a community which was changing, but which still had old &#8216;love songs&#8217; as an important part of how it understood the world. Today, not so much. People still relate to the world and understand it through songs, but the songs are more likely to be contemporary. Lyrically, many of the love songs that Sheila and her family sing could have been written yesterday, but their performance is radically different from contemporary style. One voice, unaccompanied, a style that requires the listener to concentrate on the song rather than any aspects of production. Not something you&#8217;re going to dance to at your wedding, say.</p>\n<p>Sheila&#8217;s classes, on Meeting House Songs (more later) and her Ballads class with Bobbie McMillon were just wonderful; I won&#8217;t forget in a hurry the sound Bobbie singing &#8220;A conversation with Death&#8221; as a thunderstorm grumbled across the campus in the background. Spine tingling stuff. Sheila&#8217;s description of how she learned songs &#8220;knee to knee&#8221; has been helpful too. The way it would work was that the teacher and student would be sat out on the porch, often doing some chore or another, and the teacher would sing the first verse of a song. The student would sing it back and the teacher would sing the second verse. The student would then sing the first two verses then the teacher would sing the third verse and the student would sing the first three verses and so on, until the student was singing the whole song back to the teacher. A time consuming process to be sure, but it works.</p>\n<p>I know this because I learned Pretty Saro from a recording of Sheila&#8217;s late husband Jim Taylor, using a variant of the method, &#8220;knee to CD&#8221; if you like. I&#8217;d play the first verse, hit pause and sing it back, play the second verse, pause, repeat the first two… and so on. And in very short order I had the words and tune (up to a point; I listened back to that recording again recently and I&#8217;m singing a different tune now) and could start the process of actually <em>learning</em> the song, which involved singing it it lots, listening to other recordings, singing it some more and then taking the song out and trying it out in front of audiences and listening to what works and what doesn&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve never really finished learning a song; this recording is a snapshot. I hope you enjoy it.</p>"

My childhood reading and yours may not intersect all that much.</p>\n<p>So&#8230;</p>\n<h4>The Walkers and the Blacketts</h4>\n<p>Also known as the <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=intitle:%22Swallows+and+Amazons%22\">Swallows and Amazons.</a> <cite>Swallows and Amazons</cite> is the first &#8216;big&#8217; book that I can remember reading for myself. We were in Cornwall, holidaying at the same place my mum&#8217;s been going to since she was a kid. Mum was reading <cite>Swallows and Amazons</cite> to us, and it was great, but I was impatient to find out what happened next, so I took the book to bed with me and read it for myself. I haven&#8217;t stopped yet. <cite>Swallows and Amazons</cite> was the book that opened my door to reading for pleasure. It opened up a way of looking at the world too. I can&#8217;t imagine who I&#8217;d be if I&#8217;d never read any Ransome.</p>\n<h4>The Pevensies</h4>\n<p>The Pevensies are the family in <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=intitle:%22The+Lion+The+Witch+And+The+Wardrobe%22\">The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe,</a> the first of the Narnia books. I have a slightly troubled relationship with these books now. I <em>really</em> don&#8217;t get on with C. S. Lewis&#8217;s view of the world (I once hurled a taped reading of <cite>The Screwtape Letters</cite> out of the car rather than listen to another word of the bloody things), but I wasn&#8217;t reading between the lines when I was nine. I was just loving the stories and the images they put in my head. And what images&#8230;</p>\n<h4>Simp, the Canine Cannonball</h4>\n<p>What do you mean, you&#8217;ve never read <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=intitle:%22Cannonball+Simp%22\">Cannonball Simp?</a> You poor thing!</p>\n<p><cite>Cannonball Simp</cite>, by John Burningham is <em>the</em> library book for me. Back when I was 4 or 5, I would walk with my dad from Regent&#8217;s Square to the Doncaster Central Library every Saturday morning, with three books clutched under my arm. I&#8217;d hand them over the counter, receiving in exchange 3 buff cardboard library slip holders. I would then go over to the childrens&#8217; books section and pull out three new (to me) books and take them to the counter. The librarian would remove the slip from the library bookplate, place it in one of my surrendered holders and stamp the slip and the bookplate with the date, three weeks hence, by which the book must be renewed.</p>\n<p>Well, that&#8217;s how it worked until weekend I came back with <cite>Cannonball Simp</cite>. I <em>loved</em> it. I didn&#8217;t want to take it back because I hadn&#8217;t learned it yet. Sure I could &#8216;read&#8217; along with Dad &#8211; I knew all the words by then &#8211; but the pictures were another thing entirely. They were <em>beautiful</em>. They still are.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s when I learned of the magic of &#8216;renewal&#8217;. Instead of handing the book back, I showed it to the librarian and said &#8220;I&#8217;d like to renew this, please,&#8221; and instead of giving me my library card back, they just stamped the book and slip with a new date. Wow! It was like I <em>owned</em> the book.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know how many times I renewed that book. I&#8217;m afraid I don&#8217;t remember the words any more. But I still remember the pleasure that it gave me.</p>\n<h4>Galadriel the Fair</h4>\n<p>On the last day of junior school our form teacher, Miss Rees, wrote a long list of books on the board and asked us to copy the list into the back of our exercise books. She said that these were books we should try and read. I don&#8217;t have the exercise book any more and I remember very little of the list. I do remember that I&#8217;d already read some of them. And I remember <cite>The Hobbit</cite> and <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=intitle:%22The+Lord+of+the+Rings%22\">The Lord of the Rings</a>. Oh boy, do I remember <cite>The Hobbit</cite> and <cite>The Lord of the Rings</cite>.</p>\n<p>Terry Pratchett said that if you&#8217;re a 14 year old boy and you don&#8217;t think that The Lord of the Rings is the best book ever written then there may be something wrong with you, but if you&#8217;re 28 and you <em>still</em> think it&#8217;s the best book ever written then there&#8217;s <em>definitely</em> something wrong with you. I <em>was</em> that 14 year old boy. I stayed up all night reading it. I fell asleep reading it. I read the appendices. I worked out how to write my name in Elvish script. I even read <cite>The Silmarillion</cite> and thought I enjoyed it. I can still recite some of the poetry. In Elvish. I&#8217;ve forgotten the words of Cannonball Simp, but get me going with &#8220;A Elbereth Gilthoniel&#8230;&#8221; and I can just about reel off the rest of the poem. What&#8217;s wrong with me?</p>\n<p>By the time I was 28, LotR wasn&#8217;t the best book ever written. I&#8217;m no longer sure that there is such a thing as &#8220;The Best Book Ever Written&#8221;. Still, if you haven&#8217;t at least read <cite>The Hobbit</cite> you should take steps to rectify matters. Or wait for the Peter Jackson movie.</p>\n<h4>The Daughter of a Pirate King</h4>\n<p>Confession time: I haven&#8217;t read <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=intitle:%22Pippi+Longstocking%22\">Pippi Longstocking</a>. The &#8216;I&#8217; of <cite>A Child of the Library</cite> is a composite of Gill and me. <cite>Pippi Longstocking</cite> was her Nancy Blackett. The  <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=Bastable+inauthor:Nesbit\">Bastables</a> were her Pevensies.</p>\n<h4>Paddington the Bear</h4>\n<p>Once I&#8217;d learned that reading for myself was pure pleasure, I read anything and everything I could find in the library and I discovered Michael Bond&#8217;s <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=intitle:Paddington+inauthor:%22Michael+Bond%22\">Paddington Bear</a>. Paddington was a well meaning young bear from Peru who was found, wearing a duffel coat and a label reading &#8220;Please look after this bear&#8221;, at Paddington Station by the Brown Family. The Browns took him in immediately, named him Paddington after the station and&#8230; &#8216;hijinks ensue&#8217;.</p>\n<p>I would be quietly reading these books to myself when some episode or another (&#8220;Baked Elastic&#8221;; the Russian ballet dancer; the wobbly table&#8230;) would cause me to laugh out loud and my brother would demand to know what was funny and made me read whatever it was aloud to him. I have to confess, I resented this, but not enough to dent my enjoyment. The Paddington books are made of joy.</p>"

14bd0f3b-e0c4-3bc0-226e-b65c149e341d.description	"<p>Or… what I did this summer.</p>\n<p>Summer as been frantic. Mostly joyous, but frantic.</p>\n<p>I had talks accepted at both <a href=\"http://www.yapc2011.us/yn2011/\"><span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span></a> and <a href=\"http://oscon.com/\"><span class=\"caps\">OSCON</span></a>. Because <span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span> was in Asheville, and the <a href=\"http://www.swangathering.com/\">Swannanoa Gathering</a> Traditional Song Week fell the week after <span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span>, that meant I flew out to Asheville for an intense fortnight of Perl community engagement followed by a week spent singing myself hoarse and being blown away by <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/sheilakayadams\">Sheila Kay Adams&#8217;s</a> singing and her stories of mountain life and listening to future stars like <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/sheilakayadams\">Sam Gleaves</a> and inspiring activists like <a href=\"http://www.blairpathways.com/\">Saro Lynch Thomason</a>. I could write entire posts on every one of those, and that&#8217;s before I get on to the magic of watching the sun go down and the fireflies come up from the grass of the Warren Wilson College&#8217;s natural amphitheatre. Magical so it was.</p>\n<p>On the last night of the gathering, there was a student showcase. Of course, I sang <a href=\"http://www.bofh.org.uk/child-of-the-library\">Child of the Library</a>. Rather embarrassingly, I skipped a verse, but the response was great. Several people came up to me afterwards and told me their library stories and, I hope, went home with a determination to help protect their libraries.</p>\n<p>Then it was back to the UK for a fortnight before heading off again to <span class=\"caps\">OSCON</span> in Portland, OR. I was down to give two talks, one on <a href=\"http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011/public/schedule/detail/17872\">Higher Order Javascript</a> and a second on <a href=\"http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011/public/schedule/detail/18577\">Polymorphic Dispatch</a> which proved to be a bear to write. I&#8217;d planned to have everything done and dusted and the slides learned by the time I flew out, but spent a huge amount of time blocked on how I was going to present the ideas using a motivating problem that hit the sweet spot between too simple and too complicated. It wasn&#8217;t until I arrived in Portland and talked things through with my host, <a href=\"http://www.justatheory.com/\">David Wheeler</a>, that I got that worked out. The slides were written in a tearing rush and weren&#8217;t as good as I would like them to be. I still owe the talk attendees a full writeup, so I&#8217;ll take this opportunity to apologise for the lateness and promise that a writeup <em>will</em> arrive. The Javascript talk was based on one I&#8217;ve given before, but I&#8217;m starting to realise that it&#8217;s a full tutorial masquerading as a short talk. More on that later, I hope.</p>\n<p>What with flapping about the unwritten talk, and the 10 minute gap between them, I didn&#8217;t really worry overmuch about the Perl lightning talks. It&#8217;s been my practice to sing a lightly massaged version of <a href=\"http://LOUANDPETER.COM/\">Lou and Peter Berryman&#8217;s</a> very splendid song <cite>A Chat With Your Mother</cite> with tailored verses about different language communities and various Perl luminaries. I <em>had</em> decided to retire it, but at <span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span> I came up with a snide verse about myself and another about Larry Wall, so it felt renewed enough to be worth singing this year as well. I ended up singing Child of the Library again.</p>\n<p>The response was phenomenal. I&#8217;ve been singing it for long enough now that I know it <em>gets</em> people. Hell, when I was writing it, there were verses that were hard to sing because they got me and I was choking up as I tried to sing them. But the lightning talk got a standing ovation. Again people were telling me library stories and I found that the UK isn&#8217;t the only country with local governments stupid enough to consider closing libraries, it was happening in the US too. So, fired up by that response, I went to see Sarah Novotny and begged her for five minutes on the <span class=\"caps\">OSCON</span> stage before the closing keynote. Bless her, she let me have it.</p>\n<h3>Pics, or it didn&#8217;t happen!</h3>\n<p>I have proof too! The main stage at O&#8217;Reilly events has serious video equipment pointed at it. Because it&#8217;s important that people get to see serious talks about <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnX5v0uwNjc&amp;list=PL93FC98105B19725C&amp;index=39&amp;feature=plpp\">known bugs and exploits in wetware</a>. Because my performance wasn&#8217;t on the schedule, and I didn&#8217;t have a video release all signed and ready to go beforehand, it&#8217;s taken a while to get the video available. But last night, that changed, so here I am, in all my corpulent glory. Enjoy. And please, spread this video as far and as wide as you can. Libraries are important.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"345\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/MDi5JtS1H-g\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>"

This happens as I sing  it out to different audiences and find out which bits work, which bits are hard to sing and all the other little details that you only find out when there&#8217;s a living, breathing, listening and (hopefully) singing audience in front of you.</p>\n<p>It turns out that the same things happens with songs I&#8217;ve written.</p>\n<p>The biggest stumbling block of the original version is the last line of the first verse:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My wife met Pippi Langstumpf, I met Paddington the Bear</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Someone on the comment thread suggested:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Heidi, Pippi Longstocking and Paddington the Bear</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which is fine, except that means singing &#8216;PIPpi LONGstockING&#8217;, and I&#8217;m not happy with putting the emphasis on the <span class=\"caps\">WRONG</span> sylLABles if I can possibly help it. In the revised version, I think I&#8217;ve cracked it. The line is now:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The daughter of a pirate king and Paddington the bear</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which is <em>much</em> easier to sing and follows the rest of the verse by being a more oblique reference to the character. If you know who Pippi is, then it&#8217;s obvious who I&#8217;m singing about. If you don&#8217;t, then maybe I&#8217;ve piqued your curiosity.</p>\n<p>The first recording also had two slightly different tunes for the verses, this version has settled on just the one.</p>\n<p>And, for people who care about that sort of thing, this was recorded with a click track at 110bpm rather than speeding up over the course of the song, which should make life a little easier for anyone taking part in Rabid Gravy&#8217;s <a href=\"http://blog.rabidgravy.com/making-music-to-save-our-libraries\">project</a> to remix and rerecord different versions of the song.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re concerned about Library closures, a good place to start is <a href=\"http://www.voicesforthelibrary.org.uk/\">Voices for the Library</a>. If you&#8217;re on twitter, you might also start following <a href=\"http://twitter.com/ukpling\">@ukpling</a>. If you&#8217;re not concerned about library closures, why on earth did you read this far, and what kind of excuse for a human being are you?</p>"

Most importantly, both of us grew up in houses where no book was out of bounds. Our fathers used to take us to our respective local libraries (Lewisham for Gill, Doncaster Central and then Bawtry for me) every week or so on a Saturday morning. As soon as I was old enough, I&#8217;d ride my bike from our home in Scrooby to Bawtry with a carrier full of books hanging off the handlebars. Bawtry is currently in the crosshairs of Doncaster&#8217;s idiot mayor &#8211; the bloke who suggested getting kindles for everyone instead &#8211; along with 13 other libraries in the district.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a revised version of the recording with additional notes at: http://www.bofh.org.uk/2011/04/04/a-child-of-the-library-revised, or just press play:</p>\n<p><object height=\"81\" width=\"100%\"> <param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F13031396\"></param> <param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param> <embed allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"81\" src=\"http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F13031396\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed> </object>  <span><a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/pdcawley/child-of-the-library-revised\">Child Of The Library (Revised)</a> by <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/pdcawley\">pdcawley</a></span></p>\n<h5>August 9th 2011</h5>\n<p>I&#8217;ve updated the lyrics here to reflect what I sing now.

5811e4bd-990b-be48-e5d0-152d79c015d1.description	"<p>When I wrote <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Plack::Middleware::BotDetector\">Plack::Middleware::BotDetector</a>,\nI planned to use it only for filtering out non-humans from our <a\nhref=\"http://outspeaking.com/words-of-technology/what-is-cohort-analysis.html\">cohort\nanalysis</a> system. (You can read the entire rationale and explanation in <a\nhref=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2012/08/detecting-bots-and-spiders-with-plack-middleware.html\">Detecting\nBots and Spiders with Plack Middleware</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>Since I wrote that article, I extracted that middleware from our project and\nreleased it on its own as <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Plack::Middleware::BotDetector\">Plack::Middleware::BotDetector</a>.\nAs is often the case, solving one problem suggests the possibility of solving\nmultiple problems.</p>\n\n<p>When I build systems that analyze data, I try to make it possible that the\nanalysis can improve over time. Anomalous cases should be obvious and easy to\ncorrect and, when corrected, should no longer be obvious (because they're no\nlonger anomalous). When detecting non-human user agents, we analyze our access\nlogs for likely candidates to add to the list used to construct the regex\npassed to <code>Plack::Middleware::BotDetector</code>.</p>\n\n<p>I had written a small Perl program to analyze our logs and give a histogram\nof user agents, but I still ended up eyeballing that list to see if any new bot\nuser agents had appeared. (You can tell your SEO strategy is working when you\nget more bot traffic.)</p>\n\n<p>Anytime you find yourself reviewing data by hand, ask yourself if a computer\ncan do it.</p>\n\n<p>We use <a href=\"http://plackperl.org/\">Plack</a>, obviously. <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Plack::Runner\">Plack::Runner</a> enables\ndefault middleware, including <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Plack::Middleware::AccessLog\">Plack::Middleware::AccessLog</a>.\nThat's responsible for writing an access log (you can configure the location),\nand we used that because it was easy and available.</p>\n\n<p>\"Wait,\" I asked myself. \"Why am I reviewing this log information when I have\nto remember to exclude most of it because <em>I already know it's bot\ntraffic</em>?\" More important, our system already knows it's bot traffic,\nbecause the BotDetector middleware is already excluding those requests our from\ncohort analysis event logging.</p>\n\n<p>What if I used the BotDetector to decide whether to log a request's\ninformation? (We don't do anything with these access logs which requires us to\nkeep data about bot traffic.) That way, every update to the BotDetector regex\nwould exclude more and more bot traffic, and the only things we'd see in our\ndaily reports would be real users and bots we needed to exclude.</p>\n\n<p>I wrote a custom piece of middleware in about two minutes:</p>\n\n<pre><code><span class=\"Statement\">package</span><span class=\"Type\"> MyApp::Plack::Middleware::AccessLogNoBots</span>;\n<span class=\"Comment\"># ABSTRACT: Plack middleware which only logs non-bot requests</span>\n\n<span class=\"Statement\">use </span>Modern::Perl;\n<span class=\"Statement\">use parent</span> <span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">Plack::Middleware::AccessLog</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span>;\n\n<span class=\"Statement\">sub </span><span class=\"Identifier\">call</span>\n{\n    <span class=\"Statement\">my</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$self</span> = <span class=\"Statement\">shift</span>;\n    <span class=\"Statement\">my</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$env</span>  = <span class=\"Identifier\">$_[</span><span class=\"Constant\">0</span><span class=\"Identifier\">]</span>;\n\n    <span class=\"Statement\">return</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">$env-&gt;{</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Constant\">BotDetector.looks-like-bot</span><span class=\"Constant\">'</span><span class=\"Identifier\">}</span>\n         ? <span class=\"Identifier\">$self</span><span class=\"Identifier\">-&gt;app</span>-&gt;( <span class=\"Identifier\">$env</span> )\n         : <span class=\"Identifier\">$self</span><span class=\"Identifier\">-&gt;SUPER</span>::call( <span class=\"Identifier\">@_</span> );\n}\n\n<span class=\"Constant\">1</span>;</code></pre>\n\n<p>This class extends the <code>AccessLog</code> middleware class to override\nthe <code>call()</code> method. If the request looks like it came from a\nspider, it passes through the request to the next middleware. Otherwise, it\nlets the parent class log the request.</p>\n\n<p>Installing this in our <em>.psgi</em> file was more difficult than writing\nthe class, which says more about how easy it was to write this class than\nanything else. The only complicating factor is that <code>Plack::Runner</code>\ntakes the responsibility for setting up its <code>AccessLog</code> component. I\nended up with something like:</p>\n\n<pre><code><span class=\"Identifier\">use</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">MyApp</span>;\n<span class=\"Identifier\">use</span> <span class=\"Statement\">MyApp</span>::<span class=\"Identifier\">BotDetector</span>;\n\n<span class=\"Identifier\">use</span> <span class=\"Statement\">Plack</span>::<span class=\"Identifier\">Builder</span>;\n<span class=\"Identifier\">use</span> <span class=\"Statement\">Plack</span>::<span class=\"Statement\">App</span>::<span class=\"Identifier\">File</span>;\n\n<span class=\"Identifier\">my</span> $<span class=\"Identifier\">app</span> = <span class=\"Identifier\">builder</span>\n{\n    <span class=\"Identifier\">enable</span> '<span class=\"Statement\">Plack</span>::<span class=\"Statement\">Middleware</span>::<span class=\"Identifier\">BotDetector</span>',\n        <span class=\"Identifier\">bot_regex</span> =&gt; <span class=\"Statement\">MyApp</span>::<span class=\"Statement\">BotDetector</span>::<span class=\"Identifier\">bot_regex</span>();\n    <span class=\"Identifier\">enable</span> '<span class=\"Statement\">Plack</span>::<span class=\"Statement\">Middleware</span>::<span class=\"Identifier\">ConditionalGET</span>';\n    <span class=\"Identifier\">enable</span> '<span class=\"Statement\">Plack</span>::<span class=\"Statement\">Middleware</span>::<span class=\"Identifier\">ETag</span>', <span class=\"Identifier\">file_etag</span> =&gt; [<span class=\"Identifier\">qw</span>/<span class=\"Identifier\">inode</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">mtime</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">size</span>/];\n    <span class=\"Identifier\">enable</span> '<span class=\"Statement\">Plack</span>::<span class=\"Statement\">Middleware</span>::<span class=\"Identifier\">ContentLength</span>';\n\n    <span class=\"Statement\">if</span> ($<span class=\"Identifier\">ENV</span>{<span class=\"Identifier\">MA_ACCESS_LOG</span>})\n    {\n        <span class=\"Statement\">open</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">my</span> $<span class=\"Identifier\">logfh</span>, '&gt;&gt;', $<span class=\"Identifier\">ENV</span>{<span class=\"Identifier\">MA_ACCESS_LOG</span>};\n        $<span class=\"Identifier\">logfh</span>-&gt;<span class=\"Identifier\">autoflush</span>( <span class=\"Constant\">1</span> );\n\n        <span class=\"Identifier\">enable</span> '+<span class=\"Statement\">MyApp</span>::<span class=\"Statement\">Plack</span>::<span class=\"Statement\">Middleware</span>::<span class=\"Identifier\">AccessLogNoBots</span>',\n            <span class=\"Identifier\">logger</span> =&gt; <span class=\"Statement\">sub</span> { $<span class=\"Identifier\">logfh</span>-&gt;<span class=\"Statement\">print</span>( @<span class=\"Identifier\">_</span> ) };\n    }\n\n    <span class=\"Identifier\">MyApp</span>-&gt;<span class=\"Identifier\">apply_default_middlewares</span>(<span class=\"Identifier\">MyApp</span>-&gt;<span class=\"Identifier\">psgi_app</span>);\n};</code></pre>\n\n<p>... where the presence of the environment variable governs the location of\nthe access log file. I also changed the scripts we use to launch this\n<em>.psgi</em> file to pass the <code>--no-default-middleware</code> flag to\n<code>Plack::Runner</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The results have been wonderful (except that our site looked a lot busier\nbefore, when the logs showed Baidu spidering the whole thing at least twice a\nday). The decorator pattern of Plack continues to demonstrate its value, and the cleanliness of extension and ease of writing this code argues yet again for putting conditionals (log or don't log) where they belong.</p>\n\n<p>All I could ask for is a little more customizability for\n<code>Plack::Runner</code> to make some of the code in my <em>.psgi</em> file\ngo away, but I'm probably at the point where it makes sense to avoid\n<code>plackup</code> and write my own program which calls\n<code>Plack::Runner</code> directly.</p>"

Fortunately Mark Fowler reminded me that I forgot it: <a\nhref=\"http://blog.twoshortplanks.com/2012/09/13/another-feature-perl-5-needs-in-2012/\">Perl\n5 needs structured core exceptions</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I've written before about <a\nhref=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2010/07/dont-parse-that-string.html\">the\ndifficulties of parsing unstructured data</a> in a sensible way. That goes for\nthe strings passed to two-argument <code>open</code>, for <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?DBI\">DBI</a> connection strings, for the\ntext of exception messages, and even the contents of subroutine attributes.</p>\n\n<p>If an exception is only a string, everyone who has to get any relevant\ninformation from that string&mdash;if that information is even\npresent&mdash;has to parse that string. If that information isn't present,\nadding it is difficult because you might break existing code that already\nparses it.</p>\n\n<p>I've been experimenting with a way to add a core exception type to Perl 5 in\na mostly backwards-compatible way. It's not yet ready to show off, but I can\nshow the language-level interface I'm contemplating.</p>\n\n<p>At a minimum, exception objects can and should include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>The string text of the exception we're all used to, say \"Attempt to bless into a reference\".</li>\n\n<li>The name of the file which generated the error, if tracked (and it's almost always tracked)</li>\n\n<li>The number of the line which generated the error, if available (and it's almost always available)</li>\n\n<li>The type of the exception</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The latter is a little more controversial; it requires a lot of people to\nagree on some sort of classification system for exceptions, like \"data access\nerror\" or \"IO error\". It probably requires a system of roles, rather than a\nsingly-rooted hierarchy, because some types of errors overlap. It ought to be\nvisible to user code so users can define their own error types.</p>\n\n<p>(The <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?warnings\">warnings</a>\ncategorization isn't perfect, but it works in most cases, so making a similar\nsystem is indeed possible.)</p>\n\n<p>I've considered also adding a severity, but I don't know that that's broadly\nuseful. It may be a possibility for future extension if necessary.</p>\n\n<p>Modifying the core to <em>produce</em> these exceptions will touch a lot of\ncode, but it's not exceedingly difficult. Nor is making that system available\nto XS modules difficult. The difficult part is dealing with Perl 5 code which\ndoes:</p>\n\n<pre><code>{\n    <span class=\"Identifier\">local</span> $@;\n\n    <span class=\"Identifier\">eval</span> { <span class=\"Identifier\">some_code</span>() }\n\n    <span class=\"Statement\">if</span> (<strong><span class=\"Identifier\">ref</span>  $@</strong>) { ... }\n    <span class=\"Identifier\">else</span> <span class=\"Statement\">if</span> ($@) { ... }\n    <span class=\"Identifier\">else</span>         { ... }\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>In particular, the open question is whether to make <code>ref()</code> lie,\nwhether to promote exceptions to objects in a lexical scope with a <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?feature\">feature</a> enabled, or whether\nto perform some weird magic and add a feature to extract an exception object\nfrom an exception which looks like a string.</p>\n\n<p>(I hope I'm kidding about the last one.)</p>\n\n<p>An exception object would be a normal object and you'd use methods to read\nits attributes.</p>\n\n<p>I haven't thought at all about how to <em>produce</em> an exception object\nat the Perl 5 language level. Perhaps a new keyword such as <code>throw</code>\n(protected by <code>feature</code>) is in order. Overloading <code>die</code>\nwith magic to detect a hash reference won't work, nor will changing its\nbehavior when it receives a list of arguments.</p>\n\n<p>Even with all of these open questions, making this feature <em>work</em> is\nreasonably straightforward and mostly self contained. It's easy enough to\nrefine over time, but it does offer a measurable amount of improvement at the\nlanguage level.</p>\n\n<p>I'll keep exploring.</p>"

afbf5645-ffdb-adcf-c466-8482c47bf490.description	"<p>In <a\nhref=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2012/09/features-perl-5-needs-in-2012.html\">Features\nPerl 5 Needs in 2012</a>, I wrote that Perl 5 needs \"compact, native-type data\nstructures\".</p>\n\n<p>While I generally <em>like</em> the polymorphism by which I can read\nexternal data into a data structure and then treat it like the kind of data I\nwant it to be (string, integer, numeric), that flexibility is never free.\nSometimes that flexibility comes at a cost.</p>\n\n<p>I have mixed feelings about the <a\nhref=\"http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/\">Computer Language Benchmarks Game</a>\nwhen used to compare languages, but its microbenchmarks are good targets for\nprofiling data. (I used that strategy to good effect when I worked on Parrot.\nCertainly Parrot could benefit from other performance improvements, but\nremoving low-hanging bottlenecks to maximum performance helped real programs in\nmeasurable ways.)</p>\n\n<p>Earlier this year, I profiled the <a\nhref=\"http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u64q/program.php?test=meteor&lang=perl&id=2\">benchmarks\ngame Perl meteor-contest entry</a>. I didn't expect to find any obvious\ncandidates for optimizing Perl 5, nor did I. I did find results that confirmed\nsome of my expectations.</p>\n\n<p>The program spends a lot of its time manipulating SVs. In fact, about 20% of\nthe runtime of the program goes to this. This is almost exclusively upgrading\nSVs. (An SV is the basic data type in Perl 5. It can store an integer value, a\nstring value, a numeric value, and more.)</p>\n\n<p>Here's the problem. The profile shows that this program performs almost\n65,000 array assignment operations (that's separate from a <code>push</code> or\na <code>splice</code>). This ends up in the guts of the Perl 5 function\n<code>Perl_pp_aassign</code> in <em>pp_hot.c</em>, which eventually gets to\nthis code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>\n        <span class=\"Identifier\">while</span> (<span class=\"Identifier\">relem</span> &lt;= <span class=\"Identifier\">lastrelem</span>) {    /* <span class=\"Identifier\">gobble</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">up</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">all</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">the</span> <span class=\"Identifier\">rest</span> */\n        <span class=\"Identifier\">SV</span> **<span class=\"Identifier\">didstore</span>;\n        <span class=\"Identifier\">assert</span>(*<span class=\"Identifier\">relem</span>);\n        <span class=\"Identifier\">sv</span> = <span class=\"Identifier\">newSV</span>(<span class=\"Constant\">0</span>);\n        <span class=\"Identifier\">sv_setsv</span>(<span class=\"Identifier\">sv</span>, *<span class=\"Identifier\">relem</span>);\n        *(<span class=\"Identifier\">relem</span>++) = <span class=\"Identifier\">sv</span>;\n        <span class=\"Identifier\">didstore</span> = <span class=\"Identifier\">av_store</span>(<span class=\"Identifier\">ary</span>,<span class=\"Identifier\">i</span>++,<span class=\"Identifier\">sv</span>);\n        <span class=\"Statement\">if</span> (<span class=\"Identifier\">magic</span>) {\n            <span class=\"Statement\">if</span> (<span class=\"Identifier\">SvSMAGICAL</span>(<span class=\"Identifier\">sv</span>))\n            <span class=\"Identifier\">mg_set</span>(<span class=\"Identifier\">sv</span>);\n            <span class=\"Statement\">if</span> (!<span class=\"Identifier\">didstore</span>)\n            <span class=\"Identifier\">sv_2mortal</span>(<span class=\"Identifier\">sv</span>);\n        }\n        <span class=\"Identifier\">TAINT_NOT</span>;\n        }</code></pre>\n\n<p>Essentially, for every element to assign to the array, create an entirely\nnew SV, copy in the contents of the old SV (remember, copy semantics!), and\nmove on. That copy operation ends up in <code>Perl_sv_setsv_flags()</code> in\n<em>sv.c</em> which goes through all sorts of gyrations to figure out what type\nof SV the destination should be.</p>\n\n<p>Hold on, didn't that SV already get created? Yes it did, but it's not the\nright type. It might not be big enough to hold the right data from the source.\nAfter some 400 lines of heavily macroed code, it does eventually get the right\ndata.</p>\n\n<p>This program profiles at 1.1 million SV copy operations. In almost 450,000\nof those, the source is <code>undef</code>, so nothing has to happen. In about\n580,000 of those, the source is a plain integer value.</p>\n\n<p>An integer is just data. It doesn't even need an SV if it's only ever\ntreated as an integer. It doesn't need copying, because it can happily remain\nan integer value.</p>\n\n<p>(Yes, if you're concerned that integer could ever overflow the 64 bits\nyou're probably using to store integers, you have to figure out a way to\nupgrade to some sort of arbitrary sided big integer, but that's very\ndoable.)</p>\n\n<p>It turns out that this program spends a lot of time bookkeeping polymorphic\ninternal data structures to store raw integers. That's not counting all of the\ntime spent manipulating the reference counts of raw integers or checking to see\nif you need to do anything special to get or store the value of and from a raw\ninteger.</p>\n\n<p>If it were possible to add type annotations to Perl 5 such that an integer\ncould only ever be an integer and never silently upgraded or an array could\nonly contain integers, it would be possible to update this program to get a\nsignificant amount of speed. A 10% improvement is within the realm of\npossibility, if not more. (I find the program a little too dense to skim and\nexplain at the same time I've been digging into the Perl 5 source code, so I\nwave my hands a little bit.)</p>\n\n<p>Sure, <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?PDL\">PDL</a> is great and I've\nused it effectively, and I'm fully capable of translating this code into XS\nwhere I <em>can</em> perform these manipulations in C where I <em>can</em>\nspecify their types, but crossing the barrier between Perl and PDL can be\ncostly unless you're very clever, and I don't want to write any more C than I\nhave to when Perl could make my job much more convenient.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, adding typed data structures to Perl 5 is a <em>huge</em>\namount of work. It would probably make the already complicated\n<code>Perl_sv_setsv_flags()</code> even more difficult to follow. It would\nrequire rewriting a lot of the internals. It probably depends on attaching\nthings like special behaviors to SV data structures instead of the bodies of\nPerl 5 operations, but that's also a good thing.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, using less memory and going faster is a good\nthing&mdash;and optional typing could open the door to further improvements\nsuch as type-directed optimizations and JITting.</p>\n\n<p>I know I said \"Perl 5 needs this feature in 2012\", but given the amount of work necessary to implement it, I have to back off a little bit to say that it would be nice to have. I hope you can see its value, and I hope it's possible to get it in a version of the Perl language sometime in the next couple of years.</p>"

1786db0c-9a1e-56ef-83ed-1a84d2fb46bd.description	"<p>When I wrote <a href=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2012/09/features-perl-5-needs-in-2012.html\">Features Perl 5 Needs in 2012</a>, I promised to explain my thinking. I've explained <a href=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2012/09/why-perl-5-needs-a-metaobject-protocol.html\">Why Perl 5 Needs a Metaobject Protocol</a> and previously <a href=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2010/10/reinventing-the-axle.html\">Why Perl 5 Needs a Compiler-Free Extension Mechanism</a>.</p>\n\n<p>(If you don't follow the latter link, ask yourself this: would you use Perl\n5 on another VM if you didn't have access to the CPAN? As long as any CPAN\nstack you need includes an XS dependency, you're stuck with the C\nimplementation of Perl 5. Break that dependency and... you see where this is\ngoing.)</p>\n\n<p>If you read a good book on compilers such as <a\nhref=\"http://www.amazon.com/Structure-Interpretation-Computer-Programs-Engineering/dp/0262011530?tag=onyneopre-20\">SICP</a>\nor <a\nhref=\"http://www.amazon.com/Compilers-Principles-Techniques-Tools-2nd/dp/0321486811/?tag=onyneopre-20\">the\nDragon book</a> or even a good book on <a\nhref=\"http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Common-Lisp-Peter-Seibel/dp/1590592395/ref=sr_1_3?tag=onyneopre-20\">Lisp</a>,\nwhich is half of the same thing, you'll eventually run into the idea that you\ncan represent any program in a tree-like structure.</p>\n\n<p>That is to say, any type of computation you wish to perform can be\nrepresented with the right data structure, and that data structure happens to\nbe a tree. Even the venerable \"Hello, world!\" program from K&amp;R is a\ntree:</p>\n\n<pre><code>\nSTATEMENTS\n    / \\\nprint  exit\n  |      |\n\"Hello,  0\n world!\"</code></pre>\n\n<p>(You can represent this tree in a lot of ways, but you get the idea.) As\nSICP explains, the execution model governs how you traverse this tree.\nObviously in this tree, you start at the topmost node, then evaluate leftmost\ndepthfirst until you end.</p>\n\n<p>Even though your processor likely doesn't execute programs by traversing\ntrees and your language's favorite runtime doesn't either, tree structures are\nstill very useful in compilers because they're simple data structures that are\neasy to traverse and produce and manipulate.</p>\n\n<p>This is one reason that fans of Lisp think that Lisp is the ultimate\nprogramming language: you write it by writing this tree directly as source code\nand you can manipulate that tree with source code as if it were a tree, because\nit is.</p>\n\n<p>Many of the rest of us don't want to spend the rest of our lives writing\ntrees by hand, but sometimes we <em>do</em> want to do things with source code\nwithout having to write our own compilers, or at least our own parsers.</p>\n\n<p>Do you know know people say \"<a\nhref=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2009/08/on-parsing-perl-5.html\">Parsing\nPerl is Hard</a>?\" That's because it is. It's not <em>impossible</em>, but the\nPerl 5 parser is a complicated program that mixes up the traditional roles of\nlexing and parsing such that replicating that parse completely is difficult, at\nbest. This is why writing a syntax highlighter for Perl 5 is more difficult\nthan writing one for Lisp.</p>\n\n<p>Do you know how something like <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Devel::Declare\">Devel::Declare</a> works?\nI do, and I don't want to explain it to you. It's not particularly yucky magic,\nbut it's not particularly lovely magic either.</p>\n\n<p>Do you know how Perl 5's optimizer works? It's very limited.</p>\n\n<p>Do you know how Perl 5 source filters work? Not that well! That's why <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Switch\">the Switch module</a> was\ndeprecated in the commit after it became a core module.</p>\n\n<p>Do you know how <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/PPI\">PPI</a> works? Most of\nthe time, very well, but with lots of magic and a few very well understood edge\ncases and not a lot of speed.</p>\n\n<p>All of these problems have the same root cause: it's exceedingly difficult\nto manipulate a Perl 5 program as anything other than text, because the one\nthing that unambiguously understands that program won't share its\nunderstanding.</p>\n\n<p>(That's not <em>entirely</em> true; a few years ago, Larry added a\ncompile-time option to Perl 5 to produce an annotated tree from the\nparser/lexer/compiler, but no one's done much with it.)</p>\n\n<p>A traditional compiler parses a document into a tree structure, then\nmanipulates that tree into at least one and probably more trees and finally\nemits code in another language. It's very patriotic (from tree to shining\ntree). This pattern is no accident; it's the basis of many programs (<a\nhref=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2011/08/everything-is-a-compiler.html\">everything\nis a compiler</a>).</p>\n\n<p>This process is so well understood that patterns exist for treating this\nprocess as a pipeline of tree transformations. As long as you know what kind of\ntree you're going to get and what kind of tree you need to produce, you can add\nyour own transformation step. (If that sounds like <a\nhref=\"http://plackperl.org/\">Plack middleware</a>, there's no coincidence there\neither.)</p>\n\n<p>A formalized AST in Perl 5, representing an official separation between the\nlexing/parsing and execution phases of Perl 5, made available to any and all\nprograms would let people write better syntax highlighters, sure, but also\nbetter IDEs (finding function declarations and associating them with source\ncode would be easier) or debuggers (see again \"finding things) or optimizers (a\npipeline of tree transformations) or transliterations to other VMs or languages\n(still not entirely <em>easy</em> but much more <em>possible</em>) or\nserialization mechanisms (avoid parsing; dump an AST to the execution engine)\nor even little languages atop Perl with their own parsers which compile to the\nPerl 5 AST and run as if they had been Perl all along.</p>\n\n<p>Think about that last point for a moment.</p>\n\n<p>(Think about that last point in the context of syntax weirding mechanisms\nlike <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?MooseX::Declare\">MooseX::Declare</a>, or\nanything which uses string <code>eval</code>.)</p>\n\n<p>Are you sold yet?</p>\n\n<p>Here's the bad news: this is a lot of work. It needs expertise and it needs\nresearch and planning. It needs at least one champion, and it probably needs\nfunding. The first approach will probably fail. It will take longer than anyone\nwants. The only way it will happen is if someone stubborn appears and says\n\"I'll do that!\" or \"I'll fund that!\" and gets just enough support to keep going\npast the difficult parts.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine how amazing it will be, though.</p>"

While p5p has traditionally\ndone a lot with a little, remember that any suggestions or discussions will\nonly make it into a Perl 5 release if enough effort goes into implementation to\nmake them happen. If you want any of these features to happen, contact TPF\nabout donations or volunteer your time and skills to help (even if all you feel\ncomfortable doing is helping to refine the design of a feature, that's\nworthwhile).</p>\n\n<p>I promised to explain these features in more detail. First up is a\nmetaobject protocol for Perl 5. Stevan Little and Jesse Luehrs are working on\n<a href=\"https://github.com/stevan/p5-mop\">a proof of concept MOP for Perl\n5</a>, so this feature is well underway.</p>\n\n<p>If you're not familiar with a metaobject protocol, the book <a\nhref=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Metaobject-Protocol-Gregor-Kiczales/dp/0262610744?tag=onyneopre-20\">The\nArt of the Metaobject Protocol</a> explains everything in extensive detail.\n(It's also a pretty good book about Common Lisp, so if you're interested in a\nsemi-practical theoretical exploration of why computer sciencey things like the\nlambda calculus and well-designed extension mechanisms matter, this is a great\nbook about the design and implementation of a language.)</p>\n\n<p>If you don't want to read ~350 pages right now, the short definition of a\nMOP is <em>an API for interacting with your object system</em>. Classes (if\nyour MOP supports them) are objects. You can define a new class by making\nmethod calls. You can create objects by making method calls. You can define an\nentirely new <em>style</em> of class by creating your own new metaclass with\ndifferent behaviors. This is the reason <a\nhref=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Class::MOP\">Class::MOP</a> predated <a\nhref=\"http://moose.perl.org/\">Moose</a>.</p>\n\n<p>A good MOP provides a great theoretical foundation for a wonderful object\nsystem. Where many of us have defended Perl 5's object system as \"minimal but\neffective and flexible\", a good MOP in the core would let us get rid of\n<code>bless</code> in our code... and have more good features.</p>\n\n<h2>Performance Improvements</h2>\n\n<p>Moose can be slow to start, if you have lots of little classes, all on disk\nin their individual modules. Not only are you doing lots of IO to find and load\nthose classes, but you have to build up all of the classes you've defined in\nmemory through Moose's import mechanism (<code>has()</code> and\n<code>extends()</code> and <code>with()</code> are all function calls) which\ncreates and populates a metaclass behind the scenes.</p>\n\n<p>This happens every time you start your program.</p>\n\n<p>Every MooseX extension you load changes things.</p>\n\n<p>Though some of this happens in XS, where memory use can be smaller (less\nPerl data structure overhead) and speed can be faster (the same algorithm done\nin C instead of something written atop C), much of this happens at the Perl 5\nlevel.</p>\n\n<p>A great MOP could have its own custom data structures and code in the core\nto represent classes and methods and attributes, rather than Perl 5 hashes and\narrays. A great MOP could have its own ops to handle things like introspection\nand dispatch. A great MOP could have parser support to avoid the overhead of\ncalling Perl 5 functions (or crossing the XS boundary) to perform basic\nsetup.</p>\n\n<h2>Simplicity of Alternate Object Systems</h2>\n\n<p>Perl 5's default object system is very flexible for strange people like me\nwho've programmed in far too many languages (and implemented a few) who like\nvarious features of multiple languages and think \"Hey, I know, I'll implement\nthis in Perl 5.\" You bless a reference. You invoke a method. That's it.\nEverything else you can build yourself.</p>\n\n<p>The downside is that you have to figure out how to build it yourself.\nSometimes that means even diving into the source code of Perl 5 <em>itself</em>\nto see how things happen.</p>\n\n<p>A good MOP provides a foundation on which you can provide your own custom\nbehavior. As long as you hew to the protocol it defines, you can do anything\nyou want: make a custom metaclass that allows simple and protected shared\nmemory between workers, provide automatic auditing around specific methods,\nproxy transparently to remote resources, anything.</p>\n\n<p>Better yet...</p>\n\n<h2>Interoperability Between Different Object Systems</h2>\n\n<p>One of the projects I maintain uses Moose heavily. One of its dependencies\npulls in <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Moo\">Moo</a>. The authors of\nboth object systems have gone to great lengths to make sure that both work\ntogether.</p>\n\n<p>With a good MOP in place in the core, you have to go to great lengths\n<em>not to interoperate well with other object systems</em>. The default is\ninteroperability.</p>\n\n<p>(Try that in Perl 5 now, where some of the web programming or IO classes\nbless typeglobs. Oh, you expected a blessed hash? Too bad!)</p>\n\n<h2>Syntactic Improvements</h2>\n\n<p>As I alluded to earlier, a good MOP opens the door for declarative syntaxes\nfor defining classes, methods, and attributes. We might finally get a\n<code>class</code> keyword and a <code>method</code> keyword. This is very nice\nbecause it'll be faster, but also...</p>\n\n<h2>Tool Improvements</h2>\n\n<p>... language keywords the language itself knows make their way into syntax\nhighlighters and static analysis tools and reformatters and refactorers. It's\neasy to get a list of all of the methods in all of the classes in a file when\nit's unambiguous to pick out all of the names of classes in a file because you\n<em>know</em> they all have the <code>class</code> keyword in front of them,\nfor example.</p>\n\n<p>Compare that to today, where anything that looks like a coderef in a\nnamespace is potentially a method or potentially a function and the only way to\nknow is to invoke it, and why bother even trying?</p>\n\n<h2>Current Status</h2>\n\n<p>It's difficult to argue against putting a MOP in the core. Stevan and Jesse\nare working hard on it, but they could use more eyeballs on the tests and\ndesign and certainly more testing on various platforms. If you've been looking\nfor an excuse to contribute to Perl 5.18 or Perl 5.20, this is a great place to\nstart.</p>"

But five years after the iPhone, Apple has released the sixth major version of its mobile operating system, and it is a study in subtle refinements. Apple has been <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/2012/06/ios-6-features-from-wwd/\">previewing</a> iOS 6 to the public since its WWDC conference in June, but we all know that seeing is believing. Does Apple's latest OS deliver the kind of improvements that Apple's existing and potential user base has come to expect?</p>\n<p>After having used iOS 6 for several months from the beta period through the final release, our answer is a qualified yes. It's clear that Apple's current focus with iOS 6 is refinement rather than revolution, but we're not just talking about small refinements here; iOS is more robust than ever, with a few significant improvements to the kinds of things Siri can do, a complete overhaul of Maps, improvements in privacy controls, a far more useful Photo Stream, and new phone call and Do Not Disturb features. That's in addition to a generous helping of fixes and feature improvements sprinkled throughout the rest of the OS.</p>\n<p>In this review, we'll focus on these major elements of iOS 6 and touch on some of the most important miscellaneous changes that will affect everyday users. We did the majority of our testing on an iPhone 4 and 4S, but iOS 6 runs on the iPhone (3GS, 4, 4S, and 5), iPad (2 and 3), and iPod touch (4th-gen and up). If you own (or plan to own) a compatible device, here's what you can expect from the new operating system.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/2012/09/review-ios-6-gets-the-spit-and-polish-treatment/\">Read 78 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/2012/09/review-ios-6-gets-the-spit-and-polish-treatment/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/LtsWbdw94Uq10TzrvPPmecyUAvM/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/LtsWbdw94Uq10TzrvPPmecyUAvM/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/LtsWbdw94Uq10TzrvPPmecyUAvM/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/LtsWbdw94Uq10TzrvPPmecyUAvM/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/3cXTrgT9E0g\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

Sure, the <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2011/11/dont-call-it-a-tablet-the-kindle-fire-reviewed/\">initial Kindle Fire</a> was rough around the edges, but its shockingly low $199 price tag and integration with Amazon's services won over a few (million) consumers. Amazon sold tons of Kindle Fires in December 2011, and it wasn't long before the device held the top spot on the Android hardware charts.</p>\n<p>The Kindle Fire struck us as the perfect tablet-y gift for a close relative who has been hemming and hawing about whether to get an iPad for two years straight—here's a Kindle Fire, dad, now stop e-mailing me every week about tablets. Once the gift-giving season had passed, though, what were people going to do—buy one for themselves? Many tablet and Android enthusiasts, perhaps foreseeing the coming of Google's own tablet, <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/07/divine-intervention-googles-nexus-7-is-a-fantastic-200-tablet/\">the Nexus 7</a>, stayed away.</p>\n<p>Google didn't just create a sleek, snappy, honest-to-goodness Jelly Bean tablet; it also slapped it with the same starting $199 price tag as the chunkier, lackadaisical Kindle Fire. The Nexus 7 came out of the starting gate as a better iPad competitor than the Kindle Fire had any hope of being, and the race was over almost before it had even started.<br />\n<div class=\"image center full-width\" style=\"width:640px\"><img src=\"http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/kindle_fire_hd_7_18.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"313\"><div class=\"caption\"><div class=\"caption-text\">From left: iPad 2, Kindle Fire HD, Nexus 7, iPhone 4S. </div> </div></div></p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/09/when-your-best-just-isnt-good-enough-the-kindle-fire-hd/\">Read 53 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/09/when-your-best-just-isnt-good-enough-the-kindle-fire-hd/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/K6pJ4dfm7_NYLPiSn9on3I_ieHg/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/K6pJ4dfm7_NYLPiSn9on3I_ieHg/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/K6pJ4dfm7_NYLPiSn9on3I_ieHg/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/K6pJ4dfm7_NYLPiSn9on3I_ieHg/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/FS2m-po31BA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

Somehow there are companies out there selling very high end, and \"provably secure\" cryptography gear, all based on fundamental principles of quantum mechanics. Yet, despite being <em>fundamentally</em> unbreakable, there have been quite a few publications on more-or-less practical ways for Eve to eavesdrop on people whispering quantum sweet-nothings in darkened rooms.</p>\n<p>As a bemused onlooker, I jumped on the TGV train from Paris to journey to the heart of quantum key distribution (QKD): Geneva. Geneva is where QKD was deployed in real-world demonstrations, it is the base of Id Quantique, a company that specializes in quantum physics based security products, and it is home to University of Geneva's <em>GAP-Optique</em>, a power house of quantum optics research.</p>\n<p>My goal was to discover what all the fuss was about. Who buys a QKD distribution system? Why do they bother? If QKD becomes ubiquitous, where is the battle between white and black hats going to be played out, and how will that battle change?

Originally started as a small gathering of Dungeons &amp; Dragons co-creator Gary Gygax’s friends, GenCon now finds itself the capstone event amidst a kind of golden age for so-called hobby games. Board gamers, role-playing gamers, LARPers, and war gamers all sit shoulder to shoulder in its massive play spaces, while buskers vie for their attention on the nearly 400-strong vendor floor. Boosted by satellite events like PAX and the un-closeting of an emboldened gamer population at large, there’s plenty of room for continued growth.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">Buried inside the sacred tome that is GenCon’s annual program, amidst the thousands of play sessions of new and old properties, was a listing for an entirely new event—a keynote presentation. To no one’s surprise, the keynote presentation was given by Wizards of the Coast (WotC). Their goal?

This seems easy at first. When the game begins, you invariably find yourself on a sandy beach somewhere, and a bit of experimentation quickly yields the knowledge that you can affect your environment by punching things. You can punch trees to break them apart and collect wood, for instance, which you can use to make tools, which you can use to gather more materials, which you can use to make more things. You'll just be getting the hang of the basic mechanics when night falls—and the zombies and skeletons and spiders and creepers come out to collect your soul.</p>\n<p>As the game grew more popular, Persson (known to fans by his in-game handle \"Notch\") hired staff and eventually turned over daily programming duties to other folks. These days, Notch spends his days developing other games and being <a href=\"http://penny-arcade.com/report/editorial-article/notch-interview\">interviewed</a> by famous Internet journalists, while <em>Minecraft</em> thrives on multiple platforms including PC, Mac, Linux, and XBox 360.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/09/blocks-with-friends-how-to-run-your-own-minecraft-server/\">Read 65 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/09/blocks-with-friends-how-to-run-your-own-minecraft-server/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/gF8kfzrsazCB0-hzE8UhHqMiCEY/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/gF8kfzrsazCB0-hzE8UhHqMiCEY/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/gF8kfzrsazCB0-hzE8UhHqMiCEY/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/gF8kfzrsazCB0-hzE8UhHqMiCEY/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/9tqTYR55SPM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

For every characteristic that we associate with a particular sex, the animal kingdom harbors at least one surprising exception; concepts that we believe are inextricably linked are uncoupled, and even reversed, in other species.</p>\n<p>Our sex exerts an incredible influence on our lives, influencing anatomy, appearance, behavior, and countless other traits. Socially, our sex also matters in terms of how we are understood and treated by others, because we see each other through a gendered lens. <a href=\"http://www.naceweb.org/gender/\">Female college graduates</a> are hired more often than male graduates, for instance, but earn 17 percent less than their male counterparts. Police pull male drivers over at <a href=\"http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/ascii/cdsp02.txt\">a much higher rate</a> than they do female drivers.

Available both as part of Server 2012 and as a free (as in beer) standalone installation, the third generation of Hyper-V brings with it a collection of features that largely commoditize the sorts of things you’ve gotten used to having to pay extra for. There are even a few features you couldn’t do <em>at all</em> with other hypervisors (like live migration of a server from one server to another with no shared storage between the two).</p>\n<p>Hyper-V supports a host of high-availability and “resiliency” features, such as off-site replication of servers. And it does many of those things as well or better than offerings from VMware and Citrix—regardless of whether you’re virtualizing Windows servers, Windows desktops, or Linux. And then there’s the free part: while the licenses for Windows Server itself are tied to a specific set of hardware, other operating systems can be hosted on the standalone Hyper-V server and managed as part of the same environment. All with the same sort of manageability.</p>\n<p>In this first look at Hyper-V 2012, we look at some of the high points of the hypervisor and its management environment from the perspective of a small to mid-sized enterprise. While many of the new features have been available on other virtualization platforms for some time, Hyper-V matters largely because of the way that Microsoft has tied them all up in a relatively simple and inexpensive package. This could potentially save organizations a significant amount of money—while preserving their sanity as well.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/09/first-look-hyper-v-2012-targets-vmwares-air-supply/\">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/09/first-look-hyper-v-2012-targets-vmwares-air-supply/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/qGk5X-tfvdXUa6UX_AQ5sUk8DJc/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/qGk5X-tfvdXUa6UX_AQ5sUk8DJc/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/qGk5X-tfvdXUa6UX_AQ5sUk8DJc/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/qGk5X-tfvdXUa6UX_AQ5sUk8DJc/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/FixehGsitwM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

CSC Holdings</em></a> (which everyone just calls \"Cablevision\"). The tech at issue in Cablevision was a \"DVR in the cloud,\" and because of the way the Second Circuit answered the question of whether a DVR \"performs\" a copyrighted TV show when the user hits \"play,\" the decision opened a whole range of possibilities for entrepreneurs willing to mash up technologies in ways God never intended.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/08/why-johnny-cant-stream-how-video-copyright-went-insane/\">Read 55 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/08/why-johnny-cant-stream-how-video-copyright-went-insane/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/eNJPTR7HyFJtONmnLI6gytSKGcg/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/eNJPTR7HyFJtONmnLI6gytSKGcg/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/eNJPTR7HyFJtONmnLI6gytSKGcg/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/eNJPTR7HyFJtONmnLI6gytSKGcg/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/AV9Uj-x5zmc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

That technology, supplied by a subsidiary of the French IT firm Bull, used a technique called deep packet inspection (DPI) to capture e-mails, chat messages, and Web visits of Libyan citizens.</p>\n<p>The fact that the Qaddafi regime was using deep packet inspection technology wasn’t surprising. Many governments have invested heavily in packet inspection and related technologies, which allow them to build a picture of what passes through their networks and what comes in from beyond their borders. The tools secure networks from attack—and help keep tabs on citizens.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.narus.com/\">Narus</a>, a subsidiary of Boeing, supplies “cyber analytics” to a customer base largely made up of government agencies and network carriers. Neil Harrington, the company’s director of product management for cyber analytics, said that his company’s “enterprise” customers—agencies of the US government and large telecommunications companies—are ”more interested in what's going on inside their networks” for security reasons. But some of Narus’ other customers, like Middle Eastern governments that own their nations’ connections to the global Internet or control the companies that provide them, “are more interested in what people are doing on Facebook and Twitter.”</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/08/big-brother-meets-big-data-the-next-wave-in-net-surveillance-tech/\">Read 63 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/08/big-brother-meets-big-data-the-next-wave-in-net-surveillance-tech/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/C0feMutPRInXFsJpDul1xmeaaoU/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/C0feMutPRInXFsJpDul1xmeaaoU/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/C0feMutPRInXFsJpDul1xmeaaoU/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/C0feMutPRInXFsJpDul1xmeaaoU/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/3w0FQVI8TU8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

Since the first models hit the market, the Ultrabook moniker—originally created to denote a thin, light laptop using a low-voltage Intel processor and a fast solid-state drive—has come to encompass just about any laptop that is thinner or lighter than usual.</p>\n<p>Acer's Aspire Timeline M5-481TG is one such computer. Acer officially refers to it as an Ultrabook, but its 14\" screen and 4.3 pound weight definitely push the limits of the term. That said, the M5 uses the extra size and weight to its advantage, packing a dedicated graphics processor and a DVD burner into a relatively thin-and-light frame. It's not the fastest gaming notebook on the market, and it's definitely not the thinnest and lightest. But can this laptop's specs make it a solid all-rounder, or does the approach simply produce a chunky, compromised Ultrabook?</p>\n<table class=\"specifications center\" width=\"500\">\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\" colspan=\"2\">Specs at a glance: Acer Aspire Timeline Ultra M5-481TG</th>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<th>Screen</th>\n<td>1366x768 at 14\" (112 ppi)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<th>OS</th>\n<td>Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<th>CPU</th>\n<td>1.7GHz Intel Core i5-3317U (Turbo boost up to 2.6GHz)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<th>RAM</th>\n<td>4GB 1333MHz DDR3 (officially supports up to 6GB, reports say it can support 10GB)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<th>GPU</th>\n<td>1GB NVIDIA GeForce GT 640M LE and Intel HD Graphics 4000 (switchable)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<th>HDD</th>\n<td>2.5” 5400RPM 500GB hard drive, 20GB SSD</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<th>Networking</th>\n<td>Gigabit Ethernet, dual-band 802.11n, Bluetooth 4.0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<th>Ports</th>\n<td>2x USB 3.0, HDMI, card reader, headphones</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<th>Size</th>\n<td>13.4\" x 0.8\" x 9.6\"</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<th>Weight</th>\n<td>4.30 lbs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<th>Battery</th>\n<td>3-cell 4850 mAh Li-ion</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<th>Price as reviewed</th>\n<td><a href=\"http://us.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/model/NX.M27AA.001\">$779.99</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<th>Other perks</th>\n<td>Webcam, backlit keyboard, DVD burner, 1 year warranty</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Design and build quality</h2>\n<p>The M5 is constructed entirely from plastic—the lid, display bezel, and top case are all dark gray and have a faux-brushed metal look, while the bottom of the laptop is a black, textured matte plastic. There's a bit of flexing in the top case, especially in the lid, but the laptop has a nice dense feel to it and doesn't feel overly cheap in spite of its construction. The M5 is of a uniform, 0.8\" thickness throughout, with none of the tapering seen in many Ultrabooks, and the laptop's lid sits flush with its slightly raised LCD hinge when closed. The hinge itself feels sturdy, but not so stiff that you can't open the laptop without holding the bottom down.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/trying-to-have-it-all-acers-timeline-m5-gaming-ultrabook/\">Read 35 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/trying-to-have-it-all-acers-timeline-m5-gaming-ultrabook/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/QBnChJFy55yrEvKPOY-GQ89y3g8/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/QBnChJFy55yrEvKPOY-GQ89y3g8/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/QBnChJFy55yrEvKPOY-GQ89y3g8/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/QBnChJFy55yrEvKPOY-GQ89y3g8/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/o0lGdZeWgcg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

Well, \"watching\" per se. You're actually staring into the ever-present glow of your smartphone ready to read an urgent memo from your boss; hoping to next check live stats because you're <em>so close</em> to finally winning a fantasy football game.</p>\n<p>Then, tragedy strikes—your phone is showing five bars, but it's slowed to a crawl. You check the available WiFi networks: \"Free Stadium WiFi.\" You select, but deep in your heart you know there's no chance of connecting up here, 100 feet below the cloud cover. And that's when you come to a horrific realization: I'm going to have to put my phone in my pocket and <em>actually</em> pay attention.</p>\n<p>It's a “scary” thought for sports fans: Someday soon, the wireless network at your favorite team’s stadium could be so congested you’ll actually be forced to—gasp!—watch the game you paid a ticket for. People like Katee Panter, VP of infrastructure technology at Madison Square Garden in New York, fear growing use of smartphones and tablets to surf the Web or stream video will make it difficult to provide cellular and WiFi connections for everyone. Teams are taking advantage of fans' handheld devices by building apps to serve up interactive experiences or provide an easier way to order food and beverages.

351ce8a9-c718-c2d5-bc9e-951f98d0586b.description	"<p>We had such hopes for Intel's Ultrabook movement. With the first clarion call, we <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2011/09/ultrabook-intels-300-million-plan-to-beat-apple-at-its-own-game/\">dreamed of a PC</a> that would shatter Apple's monopoly on high-quality ultra-thin-and-light notebooks. In the first year of the Ultrabook campaign, we saw a few possible claimants to the throne, but in general, each entry was more disappointing than the last. The machines became notorious for using workarounds like larger screens (a 14-inch monitor in a 13-inch body!) and hard disk drives with flash caches (rather than actual solid-state drives) to skirt Intel's Ultrabook speed and size requirements.</p>\n<p>Nearly a year after Intel launched the initiative, manufacturers have finally taken the Ultrabook specs to heart. Lenovo's ThinkPad X1 Carbon reflects what we feel is the <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/01/ultra-in-name-only-the-failures-of-intels-ultrabook-rules/\">true spirit of an Ultrabook</a>: a light, thin body with powerful internals. Lenovo gets it. At long last, PCs have a real shot at the segment Apple has been dominating for years with the MacBook Air.</p>\n<div class=\"image center full-width\" style=\"width:640px\"><img src=\"http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/thinkpad_x1_carbon_keyboard.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"508\"></div>\n<h2>The touch, the feel of rubberized silicone</h2>\n<p>First, the waifish body: at a base 2.99 pounds, 0.31 inches at its thinnest point, and 0.74 inches at its thickest, the X1 Carbon has similar dimensions to the MacBook Air (2.96 pounds and 0.68 inches at its thickest). But that's the 13-inch MacBook Air; the X1 Carbon actually has a 14-inch 1600×900 screen packed into a \"13-inch body,\" as hardware manufacturers are recently so fond of saying. The extra display area is noticeable compared to a 13-inch computer, yet our backs and shoulders don't suffer any more for the extra real estate. And when we say 13-inch body, we mean it; the X1 Carbon is 13.03 inches wide by 8.9 inches deep, comparing well with the MacBook Air at 12.8 by 8.94 inches.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/a-worthy-ultrabook-appears-the-thinkpad-x1-carbon-reviewed/\">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/a-worthy-ultrabook-appears-the-thinkpad-x1-carbon-reviewed/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/EKJppYCqOw0fihWnleJoA8zArOg/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/EKJppYCqOw0fihWnleJoA8zArOg/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/EKJppYCqOw0fihWnleJoA8zArOg/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/EKJppYCqOw0fihWnleJoA8zArOg/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/yu-uBCAu2t8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

The same variety that makes it possible for you to find a laptop specifically designed to manage both your neon geranium business <em>and</em> your online polka-streaming startup also means that the market is flooded with laptops that <em>aren't</em> tailored to your particular needs. It's much more work than it's worth to educate yourself on every tiny difference between laptop A from manufacturer X and laptop B from manufacturer Y.</p>\n<p>We're here to help. To give you some guidance in this back-to-school season, we've set up three basic laptop categories. <strong>Basic laptops</strong> emphasize price over performance or size; <strong>gaming laptops</strong> emphasize performance over price or size; and <strong>lightweight laptops</strong> emphasize size over price or performance. Each is further subdivided into price ranges.</p>\n<p>Every category features picks that, in our view, represent some of the best machines available now. In most cases, we've also included a few alternatives in case something about our main pick was a dealbreaker for you. With a little luck, you'll be able to find something tailored to your needs and budget.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/the-ars-pc-laptop-buying-guide-back-to-school-edition/\">Read 54 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/the-ars-pc-laptop-buying-guide-back-to-school-edition/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/4knzOxlKIRQEpXa-PjjIk2rbdOA/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/4knzOxlKIRQEpXa-PjjIk2rbdOA/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/4knzOxlKIRQEpXa-PjjIk2rbdOA/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/4knzOxlKIRQEpXa-PjjIk2rbdOA/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/azITQy1EzUw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

But the prosecutors sitting across the courtroom from him didn't work for the Crown—they were lawyers for the movie studio trade group Federation Against Copyright Theft (FACT).</p>\n<p>FACT, not public officials in the UK, was the driving force behind Vickerman's prosecution. Indeed, FACT effectively took on the role of a private law enforcement agency. Private investigators hired by FACT first identified Vickerman as the administrator of STC and built the case against him. His assets were frozen at FACT's request by a government agency—which was itself funded by FACT. And when the UK's public prosecutors decided not to press charges against Vickerman at all, FACT initiated a criminal prosecution on its own dime.</p>\n<p>This is a new development for anti-piracy efforts. Organizations like the MPAA, RIAA, IFPA, and FACT have long lobbied law enforcement officials to prosecute \"rogue sites\" and have provided them with information and logistical support to do so. But public prosecutors generally have the final say on who will be indicted. In the Vickerman case, the public prosecutors concluded that there wasn't enough evidence to merit prosecution. FACT disagreed and invoked what one lawyer told us is an \"archaic right\" for a private organization to bring criminal prosecutions against other private parties.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/08/private-justice-how-hollywood-money-put-a-brit-behind-bars/\">Read 44 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/08/private-justice-how-hollywood-money-put-a-brit-behind-bars/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/dLRxJ5Go-chXQxIhSNJvsqH5wZY/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/dLRxJ5Go-chXQxIhSNJvsqH5wZY/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/dLRxJ5Go-chXQxIhSNJvsqH5wZY/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/dLRxJ5Go-chXQxIhSNJvsqH5wZY/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/LKpXpY0nyuA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

With the rise of whole new classes of \"personal computers\"—tablets and smartphones—it's worth updating all the numbers once more. And when we do so, we see something surprising: the adoption rates for our beloved mobile devices absolutely blow away the last few decades of desktop computer growth. People are adopting new technology faster than ever before.</p>\n<p>Humans are naturally competitive creatures. Not only do we compete with each other for money and power, but we form strong allegiances to various tribes. Whether it's a favorite sports team or a chosen computing platform, we passionately cheer when they win and feel a punch in our guts when they lose. Companies know this, and they will trumpet their successes and quietly hide their failures. But is it any more important to want one multi-billion dollar company to win over another than it is to root for one arbitrary multi-million dollar athlete? Is it anything more than cheerleading?</p>\n\n<p>Well—there's certainly plenty of cheerleading, but tracking the rise of fall of market share over time has more serious uses, too. Software developers need to keep track of market share so they can decide where to invest their resources. Consumers may then choose platforms based on software availability. Platforms can live—and sometimes die—by market share. The successes and failures of one generation of platforms affect the next, and ultimately this has an impact on everyone's digital lives.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/business/2012/08/from-altair-to-ipad-35-years-of-personal-computer-market-share/\">Read 50 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/business/2012/08/from-altair-to-ipad-35-years-of-personal-computer-market-share/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/flSZkEK2_wLwv67uQ_nkbYUcorc/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/flSZkEK2_wLwv67uQ_nkbYUcorc/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/flSZkEK2_wLwv67uQ_nkbYUcorc/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/flSZkEK2_wLwv67uQ_nkbYUcorc/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/jYz2MMZLQqY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

It builds on the voice actions system that Google offered in previous versions of Android, adding support for natural language queries, but it also has a passive mode in which it will display contextually relevant information through Android’s notification system. Between the two approaches, Google Now can do all sorts of things.</p>\n<div class=\"image right\" style=\"width:300px\"><img src=\"http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/2012-07-14-17.53.371-300x533.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"533\"><div class=\"caption\"><div class=\"caption-text\">It knows the important stuff.</div> </div></div>\n<p>The voice control interface in Google Now operates much like Apple’s Siri; the software records and interprets the user’s voice, parsing full sentences of natural speech into commands. It responds by speaking back to the user and displaying relevant information. You can use the speech interface to dictate an e-mail or text message, search Google, perform a calculation or unit conversion, get the definition of a word, get a stock quote, search the platform’s built-in addressbook, set an alarm, play a song, get travel directions, get the current weather conditions in a region, or launch an application. The range of supported commands and queries is comparable to Siri's.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/review-androids-google-now-can-teach-siri-a-few-tricks/\">Read 43 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/review-androids-google-now-can-teach-siri-a-few-tricks/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/wI2qe0RCBRrNx0yq0Nt41V6Eahc/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/wI2qe0RCBRrNx0yq0Nt41V6Eahc/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/wI2qe0RCBRrNx0yq0Nt41V6Eahc/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/wI2qe0RCBRrNx0yq0Nt41V6Eahc/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/nkwuBC0j31Y\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

Its absence was brutally disappointing; thankfully, Tim Cook broke his vow of secrecy to reassure us that a new Mac Pro will arrive in 2013. But for filmmakers compressing hours of 4K footage or school labs in need of new Maya machines, that’s a long time to wait—perhaps too long. Since I was also in the market for a machine to help out with my V-Ray renders, I decided that the time had come to evaluate my alternatives. The current Westmere-based Mac Pro line is definitely out of sync with what’s available elsewhere, and it is no longer competitive from a price-to-power standpoint.</p>\n<p>I have heard it said that Dell, HP, and Apple split the workstation market pretty much three ways; whether or not this is true, it did seem worth taking a look at how the other big boys’ hot-rods rolled. The HP Z820 and Dell Precision T5600 are both monstrous dual-socket Intel E5-2665 Xeons clocked at 2.4GHz and, if I had to guess, I’d say that they are much like what would have replaced the dual Westmere Xeon 2.66GHz Mac Pro <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/2010/10/tri-screen-cpu-monitor-ars-reviews-the-12-core-2010-mac-pro/\">that I reviewed in 2010</a>.</p>\n<p>Of course, you can still build your own workstation, but I’m writing this for an audience who needs top-tier support and doesn’t want to chase six different companies when something goes wrong. I have my own overclocked 3930K gaming rig dual-booting Linux and Windows, but as I’ve pointed out countless times in the comments section of my Mac Pro reviews, a workstation needs to do one thing: keep working. Vendor support remains key to making this happen.</p><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/as-mac-pro-stagnates-pc-workstations-muscle-ahead/\">Read 93 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/as-mac-pro-stagnates-pc-workstations-muscle-ahead/?comments=1#comments-bar\">Comments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/fn_wIMbfc-7y7iitMeT2152bWG0/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/fn_wIMbfc-7y7iitMeT2152bWG0/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/fn_wIMbfc-7y7iitMeT2152bWG0/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/fn_wIMbfc-7y7iitMeT2152bWG0/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/features/~4/Xuqtj50gGio\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>"

12bce9f2-6754-44b5-1e92-85e21b047dd9.description	"<p>\r\n\tInternet Explorer 9 introduced support for CSS 2D Transforms. Internet Explorer\r\n\t10 Developer Preview added support for <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/WD-css3-3d-transforms-20090320/\">\r\n\t\tCSS 3D Transforms</a> and <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-animations/\">CSS Animations</a>.\r\n\tBy tapping the power of your GPU and running asynchronously from regular JavaScript,\r\n\tthese IE10 features provide a more performant and flexible alternative to traditional\r\n\tscript-based animations for Web content.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn previous blog posts, we covered <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2012/02/02/css3-3d-transforms-in-ie10.aspx\">\r\n\t\tCSS 3D Transforms</a> as well as <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/11/21/adding-personality-with-css3-transitions-and-animations.aspx\">\r\n\t\t\tCSS Animations and Transitions</a>. In this post, we introduce a more “unconventional”\r\n\tuse case for these technologies by describing the concept of “full-page animations”\r\n\tthat can be used during the navigation process to add fluidity and continuity to\r\n\tbrowsing. Our target is to achieve a seamless browsing experience in which content\r\n\tsmoothly appears into view when the user visits a page and transitions away when\r\n\the clicks on a link or performs a relevant action.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThese effects can be accomplished by transforming the HTML <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>\r\n\telement using CSS Animations. However, this use case presents some considerations\r\n\tthat we felt were worthy of discussion, such as the effect of layout and sizing\r\n\ton transforming <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>, as well as how to appropriately time\r\n\tpage navigations so that they mesh properly with our animations.</p>\r\n<p style=\"background-color: rgb(200, 223, 251); padding: 2px 8px 6px;\">\r\n\tThe code samples in this post use unprefixed CSS markup as supported by IE10 Release\r\n\tPreview; other browsers may require vendor prefixes for the CSS Animations and CSS\r\n\tTransforms properties used.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tTransforming a Page’s Entire Content</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCSS Transforms are defined on the stylistic properties of an HTML DOM Element. For\r\n\texample, the markup for rotating an element 45 degrees along its Z axis would look\r\n\tlike this:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n\t<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">#element</span> {</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">transform</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">rotateZ(45deg)</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>}</code></p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAttaching a transform to the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element of your HTML document\r\n\tworks exactly the same way. So performing in order to declaratively add the same\r\n\teffect to your document’s <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> you could do something like\r\n\tthis:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n\t<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">body</span> {</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">transform</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">rotateZ(45deg)</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>}</code></p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLet’s look at a before-and-after shot of a page when applying a transform to the\r\n\tbody element:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\">\r\n\t<img style=\"max-width: 95%;\" alt=\"Screen shot showing applying a rotateZ(45deg) transform to the body element of a document\"\r\n\t\tsrc=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/5556.fpauc_2D00_image1.jpg\" /><br />\r\n\tApplying a rotateZ(45deg) transform to the body element of a document.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor three dimensional transformations, the CSS Transforms specification defines\r\n\tthe <code>perspective</code> property that can be specified on the parent of the\r\n\telement that we transforming. When transforming the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element\r\n\tof your content, it has to be applied to the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element that\r\n\tresides above it in the DOM hierarchy. Doing so is straightforward:\r\n</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n\t<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">html</span> {</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">perspective</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">500px</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>}</code></p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCombining this with a <code>rotateY(45deg)</code> transform on the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>\r\n\telement yields the following result:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\">\r\n\t<img style=\"max-width: 95%;\" alt=\"Screen shot showing applying a rotateY(45deg) transform to &lt;body&gt; with perspective: 500px set on &lt;html&gt;\"\r\n\t\tsrc=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/1323.fpauc_2D00_image2.jpg\" /><br />\r\n\tApplying a rotate(45deg) transform to &lt;body&gt; with perspective: 500px set on\r\n\t&lt;html&gt;.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe can manipulate the <code>transform-origin</code> property on the body element\r\n\tfor interesting results. Let’s look at a couple of examples:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n\t<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">body</span> {</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">transform-origin</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t50%</span> <span style=\"color: Blue;\">100%</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">transform</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">rotateX(45deg)</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>}</code></p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe above markup sets a rotation along X for the body element while shifting the\r\n\torigin of rotations to the bottom of the element using <code>transform-origin</code>.\r\n\tEffectively this rotates the document’s contents “into” the screen like this:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\">\r\n\t<img style=\"max-width: 95%;\" alt=\"Screen shot showing applying transform: rotateX(45deg) and transform-origin:  50% 100% to &lt;body&gt;\" src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/2728.fpauc_2D00_image3.jpg\" /></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe can also manipulate the <code>perspective-origin</code> property on the root\r\n\telement of our document to achieve an off-axis projection effect. Changing the style\r\n\tfor <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> to:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n\t<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">html</span> {</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">perspective</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">500px</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">perspective-origin</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t90%</span> <span style=\"color: Blue;\">50%</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>}</code></p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOur page now looks like this:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\">\r\n\t<img style=\"max-width: 95%;\" alt=\"Screen shot showing applying perspective: 500px and perspective-origin: 90% 50% to the &lt;html&gt; element\r\n\" src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/6038.fpauc_2D00_image4.jpg\" /></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBy using CSS Transforms, we can easily manipulate the visual appearance of the entirety\r\n\tof our page’s content. Since the usual layout and sizing rules still apply, some\r\n\ttransforms on the body element (particularly ones that use percentage values or\r\n\trely on the <code>transform-origin</code> property) can result in different visual\r\n\teffects depending on the content of our page. Recall our previous <code>rotateX(45deg)</code>\r\n\texample with <code>transform-origin</code> set to <code>50% 100%</code>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBelow you can see the results before and after the transform is applied.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\">\r\n\t<img style=\"max-width: 95%;\" alt=\"Screen shot highlighting the difference in scroll bars before and after the application of a transform under perspective projection\" src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/3806.fpauc_2D00_image5.jpg\" /></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNotice how the content does not actually pivot on the bottom of the window but rather\r\n\tat some point outside of the viewport. This is expected behavior for CSS Transforms:\r\n\tthe <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> is laid out normally, then it is rotated along its\r\n\tbottom edge that is somewhere off screen. You will also notice that the actual foot\r\n\tprint of the content has expanded (take a look at the scroll bars in the “after”\r\n\tpicture) in order to accommodate the transformed content (the fact that we are using\r\n\tperspective projection makes this effect even more pronounced).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo how do we deal with arbitrarily sized content when applying transforms to our\r\n\tbody element? Custom tailoring all content in order to ensure that the size of the\r\n\tbody does not expand more than a certain amount may be unrealistic. Instead, we\r\n\tcan use a simple HTML/CSS pattern that allows us to fix the size of the body element\r\n\tto that of the browser window and append content inside a wrapper <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>.\r\n\tThe following markup achieves just that:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n\t<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">html</span>, <span style=\"color: Maroon;\">body</span>\r\n\t\t\t\t{</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">width</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">100%</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">height</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">100%</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">min-width</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">100%</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">max-width</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">100%</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">padding</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">0</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">margin</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">0</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">overflow</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">hidden</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>}</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 2em\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>&nbsp;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">#Wrapper</span> {</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">position</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">absolute</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">width</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">100%</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">height</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">100%</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">overflow</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">scroll</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>}</code></p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe illustration below shows what happens when a page is scrolled vertically and\r\n\twe apply a <code>rotateY(45deg)</code> transform to the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>\r\n\telement of our document directly (left) and using the wrapper pattern (right):</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\">\r\n\t<img style=\"max-width: 95%;\" alt=\"Screen shot showing what happens when a page is scrolled vertically and a rotateY(45deg) transform is applied to the &lt;body&gt; element under perspective projection, with and without a wrapper CSS/HTML pattern\" src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/3884.fpauc_2D00_image6.jpg\" /></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe direct application of the transform results in a skewed visual result due to\r\n\tthe off-axis projection (since we are no longer looking at the “center” of the body\r\n\telement).

By following the principles described\r\n\tabove, we can create animations that bring our Web content into view (or remove\r\n\tit from view) in interesting ways.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tConsider this basic <code>@keyframes</code> rule:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n\t<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">@keyframes</span> rotateInLeft {</code></p>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"padding-left: 2em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">from</span> {</code></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">transform-origin</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t0%</span> <span style=\"color: Blue;\">0%</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">transform</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">rotateY(180deg)</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<code>}</code></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">to</span> { </code>\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">transform-origin</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t0%</span> <span style=\"color: Blue;\">0%</span>; </code>\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">transform</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">rotateY(0deg)</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<code>}</code></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>}</code></p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen applied to an element, this animation will cause it to rotate on its left side.\r\n\tWhen applied to a <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element that uses our wrapper pattern\r\n\tthe visual result is more interesting. The document will actually rotate from <b>outside</b>\r\n\tof the visible area of the browser window and into full view:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\">\r\n\t<img style=\"max-width: 95%;\" alt=\"Three screen shots in sequence showing the affect of applying the &quot;rotateInLeft&quot; animation\" src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/8508.fpauc_2D00_image7.jpg\" /></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSimilarly, we can compose animations that fluidly remove our Web content from view.\r\n\tFor example, if we wanted our page to disappear into the distance while rotating,\r\n\twe could use something like this:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n\t<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">@keyframes</span> whirlOut {</code></p>\r\n\t\t<div style=\"padding-left: 2em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">to</span> {</code></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Red;\">transform</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">scale(0)</span>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span style=\"color: Blue;\">rotateZ(1260deg)</span>;</code></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<code>}</code></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>}</code></p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWith the visual result being:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\">\r\n\t<img style=\"max-width: 95%;\" alt=\"Three screen shots in sequence showing the affect of applying the &quot;whirlOut&quot; animation\" src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/5852.fpauc_2D00_image8.jpg\" /></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSince we can use the full power of CSS Animations to affect the entirety of our\r\n\tWeb content, we have a lot of flexibility in terms of generating these page effects\r\n\t(and we are certainly not limited to just using CSS Transforms). But once we have\r\n\tcomposed the effects that we want to apply to our content, how do we cause them\r\n\tto trigger during the page navigation process?</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tAttaching Animations to &lt;body&gt;</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOur goal is to use trigger animations at strategic times during the browser experience\r\n\tin order to give the appearance of content transitioning into view when a page loads\r\n\tand out of view when the user clicks on a link.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe first intuitive place to add an animation to the body element would be the <code>\r\n\t\tonload</code> JavaScript event. As it turns out however, adding an animation\r\n\twhen <code>onload</code> fires is actually too late. This event actually triggers\r\n\twhen the entirety of the content in our page has finished loading (including any\r\n\timages or other bandwidth-intensive resources). Attaching an animation to <code>onload</code>\r\n\ton a bandwidth-intensive page would result in our content displaying “normally,”\r\n\tfollowed by the animation triggering and re-bringing the content into view. Not\r\n\texactly the effect that we were aiming for.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAlternatively, we could utilize the <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> event that triggers\r\n\twhen the browser has finished parsing the DOM structure of our content (but potentially\r\n\tbefore resources have finished loading). The IE Test Drive <a href=\"http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/HTML5/DOMContentLoaded/Default.html\">\r\n\t\t<code>DOMContentLoaded</code> demo</a> illustrates the difference between these\r\n\ttwo events. However, in cases of complex Web content, a modern browser may choose\r\n\tto perform “progressive” rendering, displaying the page before the entirety of the\r\n\tDOM tree has been loaded. In these situations, the visual result would be similar\r\n\tto the <code>onload</code> scenario.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe optimal place to set up an animation that transitions our page content in view\r\n\tis inline at the top of the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element. This ensures that\r\n\tthe animation will commence right as the content is being rendered (and that the\r\n\tstarting position of the content will be that of the <code>from</code> keyframe\r\n\tof our selected animation). A pleasant side effect of this approach is that the\r\n\tanimation may actually mask any progressive rendering, re-layout or resource loading\r\n\tthat can occur with complex content.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSetting up the animations that transition our content out of view is also interesting.\r\n\tOne could assume that we could attach an <code>onclick</code> handler to all elements\r\n\tof interest in our content (for instance all <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tags) and just\r\n\tset the relevant animation properties (<code>animation-name</code>, <code>animation-duration</code>,\r\n\tetc.) in the callback function. However, if we do not actually <b>delay</b> the\r\n\tnavigation from happening, we will not see our expected fluid transition.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis is a good opportunity to utilize the <a href=\"http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-animations/#AnimationEvent-types\">\r\n\t\tanimation events</a> described in the CSS Animations specification. In particular,\r\n\twe can use the <code>animationend</code> event to detect when the animation has\r\n\tcompleted and then<code> </code>trigger a navigation (by setting <code>window.location.href</code>,\r\n\tfor instance). Thus our <code>onclick</code> will trigger the “remove-from-view”\r\n\tanimation and register a handler for <code>animationend</code> on <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>\r\n\tthat will ensure that the navigation event occurs.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tLive Demo Available</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe’ve created <a href=\"http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Graphics/FullPageAnimations/\">a demonstration\r\n\t\tand tutorial on bringing pages alive with CSS Transforms &amp; Animations</a>\r\n\tthat provide depth and examples beyond what we’ve been able to show here. The tutorial\r\n\titself utilizes full page animations during page navigation that work in <a href=\"http://preview.windows.com/\">\r\n\t\tInternet Explorer 10 on Windows 8</a> as well as recent versions of Chrome and\r\n\tFirefox..</p>\r\n<p>To simply enjoy the page-to-page animations, step through the pages of the tutorial using the “Continue to ...” links in the lower right corner of each page.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAt the end of the tutorial we provide some additional guidance and sample code on\r\n\thow to incorporate these animations with your own Web content.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tConclusion</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCSS Transforms and CSS Animations are two powerful feature-sets that enable richer\r\n\tand more immersive Web experiences. This blog post outlined the considerations of\r\n\tusing CSS Transforms and CSS Animations to bring the entirety of your Web content\r\n\tto life. With a small amount of effort you can create Web pages (even static ones)\r\n\tthat provide a fluid and almost app-like navigation experience.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t—Charilaos “Harris” Papadopoulos, Program Manager Intern, Internet Explorer Graphics</p>\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div><img src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=10340682\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">"

We want to provide some more details\r\n\tabout what this means for Microsoft’s SmartScreen and the Windows 8 application\r\n\tecosystem in general.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tWindows Store &amp; Windows 8 Apps</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe introduction of the <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsstore/archive/2011/12/06/announcing-the-new-windows-store.aspx\">\r\n\t\tWindows Store</a> and <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh974576.aspx\">\r\n\t\t\tWindows 8 Applications</a> will be a significant opportunity for developers\r\n\tto distribute and monetize their applications. Windows 8 Applications are required\r\n\tto pass the Windows Store developer onboarding and application review process. This\r\n\tprocess is designed to give users confidence in the safety of their purchase while\r\n\talso making the install process as frictionless as possible. Windows 8 applications\r\n\tare not in scope for SmartScreen Application Reputation checks or warnings – these\r\n\tapps are reviewed, code signed, licensed &amp; distributed by the Windows store\r\n\tdirectly.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tDesktop Apps</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDesktop applications remain an important part of the Windows experience and Microsoft\r\n\tremains committed to the safety of the desktop experience and our users. We recognize\r\n\tthat Internet Explorer (IE) isn’t the only way users download applications from\r\n\tthe Internet, so Windows 8 now uses SmartScreen to perform an application reputation\r\n\tcheck the first time users launch applications that were downloaded from the Internet.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis evolution of SmartScreen from IE-only to system wide is a significant improvement\r\n\tfor Windows users. We have seen incredible results with this feature in IE9 (more\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.nsslabs.com/research/endpoint-security/browser-security/socially-engineered-malware-global-q3-2011.html\">\r\n\t\there</a> &amp; <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/05/17/smartscreen-174-application-reputation-in-ie9.aspx\">\r\n\t\t\there</a>). Hundreds of millions of users have avoided malware infections\r\n\tdue to these new experiences and we’re happy to bring this protection to Windows\r\n\tusers, regardless of browser choice. For more details on the IE9 application reputation\r\n\tfeature and the data models read this <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/05/17/smartscreen-174-application-reputation-in-ie9.aspx\">\r\n\t\tpost</a>. For more information on security &amp; safety features in Windows\r\n\t8 (including Windows SmartScreen) read this <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2011/09/15/protecting-you-from-malware.aspx\">\r\n\t\tpost</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe deeper integration of SmartScreen Application Reputation also means that desktop\r\n\tapp developers have an additional motivation to sign their code and establish reputation.\r\n\tWe’ve talked in the past about the importance of digitally signing code for both\r\n\testablishing reputation and proving the authenticity of programs. I’m happy to say\r\n\tthe development community has responded to this call to action. Since the release\r\n\tof SmartScreen Application Reputation in IE9 we’ve seen a 10% global increase in\r\n\tsigned downloads, from 73% at IE9 RTM to &gt;83% today.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAs we’ve discussed in the past, SmartScreen builds reputation for both individual\r\n\tprograms and for the certificate used to sign that code. Code signing is important\r\n\tto our reputation intelligence because this higher level identity allows us to build\r\n\treputation across multiple programs signed by a publisher. It is also important\r\n\tfor publishers because signed programs inherit the reputation of the certificate\r\n\twith which they are signed; this means every program a publisher distributes doesn’t\r\n\tneed to build reputation individually.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tEV Code Signing</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tToday we are announcing our support for an important advance in code signing - the\r\n\tavailability of EV code signing Certificates. We’re also announcing that EV code\r\n\tsigning certificates will integrate with the SmartScreen Application Reputation\r\n\ttechnology in Internet Explorer 9, Internet Explorer 10 and in Windows 8.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMicrosoft has been working with the CA industry over the past year to help make\r\n\tEV code signing certificates available. This code signing standard has a couple\r\n\tof key advancements from a safety and identity perspective. First, they require\r\n\ta more rigorous vetting and authentication process similar to that of EV SSL certificates\r\n\tthat are in use today. This process requires a comprehensive identity verification\r\n\tand authentication process for each developer. Secondly, the EV code signing certificates\r\n\trequire the use of hardware to sign applications. This hardware requirement is an\r\n\tadditional protection against theft or unintended use of a code signing certificate.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrograms signed by an EV code signing certificate can immediately establish reputation\r\n\twith SmartScreen reputation services even if no prior reputation exists for that\r\n\tfile or publisher. Other factors are considered when generating reputation and determining\r\n\tproduct experiences and EV-signed programs will be closely monitored over time.\r\n\tWe think the improvements in the vetting and security of these certificates are\r\n\ta great development for both users and developers.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tStarting today, EV code signing certificates are now being issued by <a href=\"http://www.symantec.com/theme.jsp?themeid=extended-validation-code-signing\">\r\n\t\tSymantec</a> and <a href=\"http://www.digicert.com/code-signing/ev-code-signing.htm\">\r\n\t\t\tDigiCert</a>, and the integration with SmartScreen is already live (IE9,\r\n\tIE10 &amp; Win8).\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDetractors may claim that SmartScreen is “forcing” developers to spend money on\r\n\tcertificates. It should be stressed that EV code signing certificates are not required\r\n\tto build or maintain reputation with SmartScreen. Files signed with standard code\r\n\tsigning certificates and even unsigned files continue to build reputation as they\r\n\thave since Application Reputation was introduced in IE9 last year. However, the\r\n\tpresence of an EV code signing certificate is a strong indicator that the file was\r\n\tsigned by an entity that has passed a rigorous validation process and was signed\r\n\twith hardware which allows our systems to establish reputation for that entity more\r\n\tquickly than unsigned or non-EV code signed programs.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tBest Practices</h2>\r\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">\r\n\tDevelopers should still follow the best practices we’ve suggested in past blog posts.\r\n\tWe have added to that guidance the additional options of distributing apps thru\r\n\tthe Windows Store and the option of EV code signing:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"margin-top: 0;\">\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-top: 1em;\"><b>Distribute your apps through the Windows Store<br />\r\n\t</b>Windows 8 Applications are required to pass the Windows Store developer onboarding\r\n\t\tand application review process. Windows 8 applications are not in scope for SmartScreen\r\n\t\tapplication reputation checks or warnings in Windows 8.</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-top: 1em;\"><b>Digitally sign your programs (Standard or EV code signing)</b><br />\r\n\t\tReputation is generated and assigned to digital certificates as well as specific\r\n\t\tfiles. Digital certificates allow data to be aggregated and assigned to a single\r\n\t\tcertificate rather than many individual programs. Although not required, programs\r\n\t\tsigned by an EV code signing certificate can immediately establish reputation with\r\n\t\tSmartScreen reputation services even if no prior reputation exists for that file\r\n\t\tor publisher. EV code signing certificates also have a unique identifier which makes\r\n\t\tit easier to maintain reputation across certificate renewals. Only Authenticode\r\n\t\tCertificates issued by a CA that is a member of the Windows Root Certificate Program\r\n\t\tcan establish reputation.<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tAt this time, <a href=\"http://www.symantec.com/theme.jsp?themeid=extended-validation-code-signing\">\r\n\t\t\tSymantec</a> and <a href=\"http://www.digicert.com/code-signing/ev-code-signing.htm\">\r\n\t\t\t\tDigiCert</a> are offering EV code signing certificates.</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-top: 1em;\"><b>Don’t sign or distribute malicious code</b><br />\r\n\t\tDistributing code detected as malicious will remove the reputation from a file and\r\n\t\talso any reputation from the associated digital certificate – even if signed with\r\n\t\tan EV code signing certificate.</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-top: 1em;\"><b>Apply for a Windows Logo or Windows 8 Desktop App Certification</b><br />\r\n\t\tLearn more about these programs here:<br />\r\n\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t\t<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/hh749939\">Windows\r\n\t\t\t\t8 Desktop App Certification</a> (required for Windows Store submissions)</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd371701(v=vs.85).aspx\">\r\n\t\t\t\tWindows Logo Program</a></li>\r\n\t\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe’re pleased with the announcement today of the availability of EV code signing\r\n\tcertificates and we’re also happy to be able to bring SmartScreen Application Reputation\r\n\tto a new set of Windows users soon with Windows 8.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t—Jeb Haber, Lead Program Manager, SmartScreen\r\n</p>\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div><img src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=10339518\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">"

d7f286aa-7d8f-a4d3-fb5d-a1108ab3aa35.description	"<p>We’re pleased to share that three new <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2011/04/webperf\">W3C Web Performance Working Group</a> specifications moved to W3C Candidate Recommendations. Accurately measuring the performance characteristics of Web applications is critical to making the Web faster. In addition, developers need the ability to effectively use the underlying hardware to improve the performance of their applications. Over the last two years, companies including Microsoft, Google, Mozilla, Intel, and Facebook have been working toward these goals through the working group. This is a great example of what’s possible when the industry and community come together through the W3C.</p>\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/navigation-timing/\">Navigation Timing</a>, <a href=\"https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webperf/raw-file/tip/specs/ResourceTiming/Overview.html\">Resource Timing</a>, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-user-timing-20110811/\">User Timing</a> and <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-performance-timeline-20110811/\">Performance Timeline</a> specifications help developers accurately measure Web application performance. The first three specifications provide developers with information related to the navigation of the document, resources on the page, and developer scripts, respectively. The Performance Timeline specification defines a unifying interface to retrieve this timing data. Prior to these API’s it was not possible for developers to accurately measure their site performance.</p>\r\n<p>To ensure these performance metrics are measured in the most accurate way possibly, the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-hr-time-20120313/\">High Resolution Time</a> specification defines a sub-millisecond clock resolution. This interface not only benefits accurate measurements of performance metrics, but also allows better frame rate calculations and synchronization of animations or audio cues.  For the first time developers can measure operations with sub-millisecond accuracy.</p>\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/page-visibility/\">Page Visibility</a>, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/animation-timing/\">Timing control for script-based animations</a>, and <a href=\"http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webperf/raw-file/tip/specs/setImmediate/Overview.html\">Efficient Script Yielding</a> specifications help developers write more CPU- and power-efficient Web applications. The Page Visibility API allows for programmatically determining the current visibility state of the page. Developers can use this data to make better CPU- and power-efficiency decisions, e.g., throttling down activity when the page is in the background tab. The <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> API, from the Timing control for script-based animations specification, allows for creating more efficient JavaScript animations. Finally, the <code>setImmediate</code> API, from the Efficient Script Yielding specification, allows developers to efficiently yield control flow to the user agent and receive an immediate callback, efficiently leveraging the CPU.</p>\r\n<p>In order to ensure Web developers only have to write code once and have it work interoperably in all browsers, the Working Group has worked diligently these last two years to standardize these APIs. The table below shows the maturity level of all the specifications currently being edited in the Working Group.</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><div style=\"display: inline-block; text-align: left;

efc7fdf5-8054-4793-0332-874ed8b10909.description	"<p>IE10 in <a href=\"http://preview.windows.com/\">Windows 8 Release Preview</a> adds support for a <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/#constructorBlob\"><code>Blob</code> constructor</a>. We earlier <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2012/01/27/creating-files-through-blobbuilder.aspx\">wrote about</a> and <a href=\"http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/HTML5/BlobBuilder/\">demonstrated</a> IE10&rsquo;s support for a <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/file-writer-api/#idl-def-BlobBuilder\"><code>BlobBuilder</code> interface</a>, an in-progress interface in the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/file-writer-api/\">File API: Writer W3C Working Draft</a>. This interface enables developers to work with files on the client PC. Recently, the W3C working group deprecated the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/file-writer-api/#idl-def-BlobBuilder\"><code>BlobBuilder</code> interface</a> in favor of a new <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/#constructorBlob\"><code>Blob</code> constructor</a>. This post explains the differences between the two.</p>\r\n<h2>Comparing Blob Constructor and BlobBuilder Interface</h2>\r\n<p>Both the <code>Blob</code> constructor and the <code>BlobBuilder</code> interface enable Web developers to create files on the client. The difference is in the syntax. Whereas <code>BlobBuilder</code> requires each portion of the blob to be appended during a separate call to the append method, the <code>Blob</code> constructor can take an array of arguments. Here&rsquo;s how to create a simple text file using both <code>BlobBuilder</code> and the <code>Blob</code> constructor:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: #006400;\">// using the Blob constructor</span></code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">var</span> textBlob1 = <span style=\"color: blue;\">new</span> Blob([<span style=\"color: maroon;\">\"Hello\"</span>, <span style=\"color: maroon;\">\" world!\"</span>], { type: <span style=\"color: maroon;\">\"text/plain\"</span>, endings: <span style=\"color: maroon;\">\"transparent\"</span> });</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 2em;\"><code>&nbsp;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: #006400;\">// using the MSBlobBuilder interface</span></code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">var</span> bb = <span style=\"color: blue;\">new</span> MSBlobBuilder();</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>bb.append(<span style=\"color: maroon;\">\"Hello\"</span>);</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>bb.append(<span style=\"color: maroon;\">\" world!\"</span>);</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">var</span> textBlob2 = bb.getBlob(<span style=\"color: maroon;\">\"text/plain\"</span>);</code></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>The <code>Blob</code> constructor takes two arguments, the array of content to put into the blob and an optional dictionary object which can include two members, <code>type</code> and <code>endings</code>. The array of content for the blob may contain blob objects, text strings or array buffers.</p>\r\n<p>Recent versions of Firefox and Chrome also support the <code>Blob</code> constructor.

bcc4e7e0-f399-9c05-2122-631aeb7ce7c8.description	"<p>\r\n\tIE10 in <a href=\"http://preview.windows.com/\">Windows 8 Release Preview</a> updates\r\n\tthe <code>responseXML</code> from an <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> to return a native\r\n\tXML document by default. This change applies to IE10&rsquo;s Standards and Quirks\r\n\tdocument modes, making them interoperable with other modern browsers and consistent\r\n\twith a “same markup” approach. Compatibility document modes 5, 7, 8, and 9 are unchanged.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis change may impact sites that were expecting <code>responseXML</code> to contain\r\n\tan MSXML document and depended on MSXML-specific functionality such as <code>selectNodes</code>. In these cases, you may request that IE10 return an MSXML by setting\r\n\tthe <code>responseType</code> member of your <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> object to <code>'msxml-document'</code>. If your code does not depend on MSXML-specific functionality, IE10&rsquo;s native XML document should work for you.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNative XML support in IE9 brought DOM parity to XML and HTML and enabled XML fragments\r\n\tto be inserted and rendered directly within a page (even in HTML). IE9 also simplified\r\n\tconverting between XML and DOM with the addition of <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2010/10/15/domparser-and-xmlserializer-in-ie9-beta.aspx\">\r\n\t\tDOMParser and XMLSerializer</a>. IE10 completes this transition by updating\r\n\t<code>responseXML</code> to return a native XML document.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLike IE9, IE10 previews before the <a href=\"http://preview.windows.com/\">Windows 8 Release\r\n\t\tPreview</a> returned an <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms763742(v=vs.85).aspx\">\r\n\t\t\tMSXML</a> document for <code>responseXML</code>.

aeed6a34-2f69-ec05-e896-785a49922e0a.description	"<p>\r\n\tThe <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/04/15/the-ie10-user-agent-string.aspx\">\r\n\t\tIE10 user agent string</a> was originally introduced in the first platform preview\r\n\tof IE10. In Windows 8 Release Preview we made two additions to aid server-side feature\r\n\tdetection.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<b>The first addition</b> enables detecting whether a machine has touch-capable\r\n\thardware via a new <code>Touch</code> token. Using this token you can present a\r\n\ttouch-friendly version of your site to users with touch-capable hardware (typically,\r\n\tin the case where your normal site is not touch-friendly). Keep in mind that users\r\n\twith touch-capable hardware may also use a mouse and keyboard. You can see where\r\n\tthis token fits into the user agent string in the examples below.\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-top: 0.5em\">IE10 on a machine without touch-capable hardware:<br />\r\n\t\t<code style=\"margin-left: 0.25in\">Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows NT 6.2;\r\n\t\t\tTrident/6.0)</code></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-top: 0.5em\">IE10 on a machine with touch-capable hardware:<br />\r\n\t\t<code style=\"margin-left: 0.25in\">Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows NT 6.2;\r\n\t\t\tTrident/6.0; <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">Touch</span>)</code></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIf you're detecting touch support client-side, do not sniff the user agent string;\r\n\tuse <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh772144(v=vs.85).aspx\"><code>\r\n\t\tnavigator.msMaxTouchPoints</code></a> instead. If the property exists and returns\r\n\ta value greater than zero, the user’s PC has touch capability. For example:</p>\r\n<div style=\"padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n\t<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">var</span> hasTouch = navigator.msMaxTouchPoints &gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t0;</code>\r\n\t\t</p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<b>The second addition</b> to the IE10 user agent string is a new architecture token\r\n\tfor ARM devices running Windows RT. This complements the existing values for other\r\n\tarchitectures. The examples below show how this compares to a few other configurations.\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-top: 0.5em\">32-bit IE10 on 32-bit Windows:<br />\r\n\t\t<code style=\"margin-left: 0.25in\">Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows NT 6.2;\r\n\t\t\tTrident/6.0) </code></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-top: 0.5em\">32-bit IE10 on 64-bit Windows:<br />\r\n\t\t<code style=\"margin-left: 0.25in\">Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows NT 6.2;\r\n\t\t\t<span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">WOW64;</span> Trident/6.0) </code>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-top: 0.5em\">64-bit IE10 on 64-bit Windows:<br />\r\n\t\t<code style=\"margin-left: 0.25in\">Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows NT 6.2;\r\n\t\t\t<span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">Win64; x64;</span> Trident/6.0) </code>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-top: 0.5em\">IE10 on Windows RT:<br />\r\n\t\t<code style=\"margin-left: 0.25in\">Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows NT 6.2;\r\n\t\t\t<span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">ARM;</span> Trident/6.0) </code>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThese additions apply to both desktop and Metro style IE10 since they expose the\r\n\tsame platform capabilities. We recommend optimizing your site’s experience around\r\n\tthe capabilities of the system (like Touch) through <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2010/04/14/same-markup-writing-cross-browser-code.aspx\">feature detection</a>, rather than\r\n\tbrowser or environment detection.

This security update resolves two privately reported vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer. The vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted Web page using Internet Explorer. An attacker who successfully exploited any of these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights. This security update is rated Critical for Internet Explorer 9 on Windows clients and Moderate for Internet Explorer 9 on Windows servers.

In total, we have submitted <a href=\"http://samples.msdn.microsoft.com/ietestcenter/\">7573 tests</a> that you can view at the IE Test Center as well. As different browsers improve their same-markup support, we can all realize the promise of HTML5.</p>\r\n<p>The title of this post refers to the <a href=\"http://testthewebforward.org/\">week-end event</a> hosted by Adobe on June 15 and 16 at their San Francisco office. Dozens of volunteers joined W3C experts and members from Adobe, Google, Mozilla, Apple, HP, and Microsoft to learn about Web standards testing, how to write CSS and SVG tests, how to file good bugs, as well as the tools available for test suite management.</p>\r\n<p>The meeting then turned into a test ‘hack-a-thon’ fueled by free drinks and food throughout the day. Volunteers spent most of their Saturday writing new test cases for the <a href=\"http://dev.w3.org/csswg/cssom/\">CSS OM</a>, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transforms/\">Transforms</a>, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-background/\">Backgrounds &amp; Borders</a>, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-exclusions/\">Exclusions</a>, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/\">SVG</a>, and other modules. Participants were then <a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/webplatform/2012/06/20/test-the-web-forward-weekend/\">nominated for several prizes</a>. </p>\r\n<h2>Testing Web Standards</h2>\r\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:0;\">Adobe’s Alan Stearns <a href=\"http://testthewebforward.org/slides/alanstearns/#/\">introduced</a> the participants to the general principles of W3C testing and the role of testing in moving specifications forward. In particular, establishing browsers’ individual pass rate for a given specification is not a goal of W3C test suites. In order for a specification to become a W3C Recommendation the Working Group must prove it can be implemented. In practice this means:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"margin-top:0;\">\r\n<li>Creating a test case for each requirement in the specification (these are known as <i>normative statements</i>)</li>\r\n<li>Verifying that at least two separate implementations pass each test</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Note the difference between ‘at least two browsers must pass the entire test suite’ and ‘at least two browsers must pass each test in the test suite’. Browser testers usually describe this phase as ‘testing the spec’. </p>\r\n<p>But an important side-effect of this testing process is to establish a common interoperable baseline that all browsers can develop and test against. Test suites help find bugs across all browsers and can sometimes identify issues in the spec.</p>\r\n<h2>Writing CSS and SVG Tests</h2>\r\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:0;\">There are three different types of tests:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"margin-top:0;\">\r\n<li><b>Stand-alone tests</b> typically rely on visual verification: <a href=\"http://test.csswg.org/suites/css2.1/20110323/html4/at-import-001.htm\">if a failure condition occurs, red content will show</a>. </li>\r\n<li><b>Reference tests</b> compare <a href=\"http://test.csswg.org/suites/css3-multicol/nightly-unstable/html4/columns-invalid-001.htm\">a test</a> against <a href=\"http://test.csswg.org/suites/css3-multicol/nightly-unstable/html4/reference/columns-toolong-ref.htm\">a visual reference</a> that has no dependency on the feature being tested.  Note that the test includes a link to the reference test against which is should be compared.</li>\r\n<li><b>CSS Object Model tests</b> depend on a JavaScript test harness; they verify that the object model reflects what static style sheets specify. For instance, this <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/MediaQueries/20120229/test_media_queries.html\">CSS media query test</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>W3C’s Doug Schepers covered <a href=\"http://testthewebforward.org/slides/dougschepers/#/\">SVG testing</a> while Adobe’s Rebecca Hauck and Jacob Goldstein provided a <a href=\"http://adobe.github.com/web-platform/presentations/test-the-web-forward-tutorial/index.html#/\">test writing tutorial</a>. Peter Linss, CSS Working Group co-chair, offered a deep dive on the <a href=\"http://testthewebforward.org/slides/peterlinss/ttwf.pdf\">CSS testing framework</a> including the test suite build system and management tools such as Shepherd.</p>\r\n<h2>Filing Good Bugs</h2>\r\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:0;\">Mozilla’s Elika Etemad then gave attendees advice on what makes <a href=\"http://fantasai.inkedblade.net/style/talks/filing-good-bugs/\">a good browser bug report</a>:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"margin-top:0;\">\r\n<li>The issue is specific and reproducible</li>\r\n<li>The build and platform are identified</li>\r\n<li>You have looked for duplicates</li>\r\n<li>It includes steps to reproduce the problem</li>\r\n<li>The expected and actual results are described</li>\r\n<li>If possible, the issue has been reduced i.e. all HTML, JavaScript and CSS that is not necessary to reproduce the problem has been eliminated from the problem page and the remainder attached to the bug.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Building a Test Suite</h2>\r\n<p>Building a test suite is a significant investment. One of the reasons it took a long time for CSS2.1 to reach the Recommendation stage was the size of the specification and the underlying number of requirements to test. The <a href=\"http://test.csswg.org/suites/css2.1/20110323/\">latest version of the test suite</a> contains 9,422 tests. </p>\r\n<p>Microsoft <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2009/01/27/microsoft-submits-thousands-more-css-2-1-tests-to-the-w3c.aspx\">contributed</a> over 7,000 of those tests, and we are continually <a href=\"http://samples.msdn.microsoft.com/ietestcenter/\">contributing more tests for other standard specifications</a>.</p>\r\n<p>In IE10, we have added support for <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh673549(v=vs.85).aspx\">a long list of new standard features across CSS, HTML, SVG and the DOM</a>. We have published some of our testcases for these new features on <a href=\"http://samples.msdn.microsoft.com/ietestcenter/\">our IE Test Center</a>. We will be submitting more, notably around those features <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2012/06/06/moving-the-stable-web-forward-in-ie10-release-preview.aspx\">recently unprefixed in the IE10 Release Preview</a>.</p>\r\n<h2>How You Can Help</h2>\r\n<p>We are excited to be part of the community working towards a more interoperable web. If you want to help move the Web forward, you too can help to drive interoperability higher. You can learn <a href=\"http://wiki.csswg.org/test/css2.1/contribute\">how to contribute tests</a>, or <a href=\"http://wiki.csswg.org/test/review\">review existing tests</a>. More information for those is available <a href=\"http://wiki.csswg.org/test/\">on the CSS WG wiki</a> as well as <a href=\"http://testthewebforward.org/\">on the event page</a>.</p>\r\n<p>We will keep you posted on future events.</p>\r\n<p>—Sylvain Galineau, Program Manager, Internet Explorer and<br/><span style=\"visibility: hidden;\">—</span>John Jansen, Test Lead, Internet Explorer</p>\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div><img src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=10325683\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">"

They were based on the <a href=\"http://www.webkit.org/blog/175/introducing-css-gradients/\">\r\n\t\t\tgradients introduced in WebKit</a>, but with improvements to the syntax. At that time, WebKit had an implementation for <code style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">-webkit-gradient()</code>.\r\n\tThe CSS Working Group iterated on the feature and altered its syntax. Radial gradients and linear gradients would be specified with separate property values, <code\r\n\t\tstyle=\"white-space: nowrap;\">linear-gradient()</code> and <code style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">radial-gradient()</code>. Fast forward a couple years and all major\r\n\tbrowsers—Chrome, Firefox, IE10 Platform Preview 1, and Opera—had introduced support for the version of CSS gradients described in the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-css3-images-20110217/\">\r\n\t\tW3C Working Draft of 17 February 2011</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen the Working Draft was closely scrutinized, several changed were suggested and after much discussion the specification was edited to reflect these changes.\r\n\tThe major changes, listed in the table above, improved the old specification by addressing issues of clarity and consistency. For instance, in the old angle coordinate\r\n\tsystem, positive angles increased in a counterclockwise manner. This is in contrast to CSS Transforms and SVG Transforms, where positive angle rotations occur in\r\n\ta clockwise manner. With the specification change, angles that describe CSS gradients are now consistent across other CSS angles and increase in a clockwise manner.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the process of changing gradients’ syntax, compatibility was a recognized concern despite the specification being in a Working Draft stage. Not all cases are\r\n\tcompatible, but much existing content will continue to work. Default values remain the same, so their rendering will be unchanged. For gradient-line direction,\r\n\tthe required “<code style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">to</code>” preposition both adds clarity and changes the valid grammar. Existing content with unprefixed gradients\r\n\tusing the old syntax will be invalid, thereby falling back on the vendor-prefixed version.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tUpdate Your Unprefixed Gradients</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNow that CSS3 Gradients are stable, we encourage you to update your gradients markup to the correct Candidate Recommendation unprefixed gradient syntax. The Internet Explorer 10 Guide for Developers includes <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh673532(v=vs.85).aspx\">full updated documentation</a> of the unprefixed syntax.  You may\r\n\talso remove instances of the <code style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">-ms-</code> prefixed gradients, as IE10 supports the unprefixed version. If you’re using corner\r\n\tkeywords or angles to describe gradient direction, you may want to verify that your gradients still render as desired.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhile vendor-prefixed gradients still work in IE10 and other browsers, adding correct support for unprefixed gradients future-proofs your content.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t—Jennifer Yu, Program Manager, Internet Explorer</p>\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div><img src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=10323746\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">"

eb72406a-f9af-8e49-a6e7-559996f9c960.description	"<p>The <a href=\"http://preview.windows.com/\">Windows 8 Release Preview</a> includes a new power-optimized, touch-friendly Adobe Flash Player. Adobe Flash content on compatible Web sites will now play in Metro style IE10. Metro style IE10 with Flash on Windows 8 enables people to see more of the Web working with high quality, especially compared with the experience in other touch-first or tablet experiences.</p>\r\n<p>On Windows 8, Internet Explorer 10 on the desktop and Metro style IE use the same integrated Adobe Flash Player with no need to download or install an additional player. IE10 on the desktop provides the same full Flash support as previous versions of IE that relied on the Flash Player plug-in from Adobe and continues to support other 3rd party plug-ins. Metro style IE continues to provide no support for 3rd party ActiveX controls or plug-ins. </p>\r\n<p>While any site can play Flash content in IE10 on the Windows desktop, only sites that are listed in the Flash section of the Compatibility View (<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/gg622935(v=vs.85).aspx\">CV</a>) list can play Flash content within Metro style IE. (Being listed in the Flash section does <i>not</i> affect a site’s document mode.) We place sites with Flash content on this list if doing so delivers the best user experience in Metro style IE with those sites. For example, how responsive is the content to touch? Does it work well with the onscreen keyboard? Is it battery-life friendly? Do visual prompts comply with the Metro style user experience guidelines? Sites that rely on capabilities that are not supported within the Metro style experience, for example, Flash rollover events and P2P functionality, and don’t degrade gracefully in their absence are better off running in IE with Flash on the desktop.\r\n<p>Site developers continue to control the content they serve to browsers. Developers can send HTML5 content to Metro style IE or express their preference that Metro style IE prompt users to run their site on the desktop (see details <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2012/01/31/web-sites-and-a-plug-in-free-web.aspx\">here</a>). Developers can also request that their site is considered for addition to the CV list for Flash. Additional technical information and details can be found in the <a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=256383\">document posted on MSDN</a>. These details include how developers can test Flash content on their own sites in Metro style IE and how to submit their sites for consideration for the CV list. The documentation also includes a best practices guide to help developers, designers, and content publishers create experiences with Flash that play well in Metro style IE. </p>\r\n<p>—Rob Mauceri, Group Program Manager, Internet Explorer</p>\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div><img src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=10323065\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">"

c8b6db6d-12f9-3527-a0db-56d1b735aaa0.description	"<p>\r\n\tBased on your feedback, we’ve improved how sites can build advanced touch experiences using gesture events in IE10 on the <a href=\"http://preview.windows.com/\">Windows\r\n\t\t8 Release Preview</a>. Earlier we wrote about <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2012/04/20/guidelines-for-building-touch-friendly-sites.aspx\">first steps\r\n\t\t\tWeb developers should take</a> to make sure their sites are touch-friendly and how to build new experiences that work well across input devices, including\r\n\tmulti-touch, using hardware agnostic <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/09/20/touch-input-for-ie10-and-metro-style-apps.aspx\">pointer events.</a>\r\n\tThis post covers IE10’s <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh772076(v=vs.85).aspx\">gesture events</a>. An example of gesture events is the <a href=\"http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Browser/BrowserSurface/\">\r\n\t\tBrowser Surface</a> Test Drive demo shown below.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\">\r\n\t<img style=\"max-width: 95%; box-shadow: 3px 3px 8px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25);\" alt=\"Screen shot of the Browser Surface demo showing pictures randomly arranged on the surface.\"\r\n\t\tsrc=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/0083.gr_2D00_image1.jpg\" /><br />\r\n\t<span style=\"display: inline-block; padding-top: 4px;\">Users can drag, pinch, and rotate photos using the <a href=\"http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Browser/BrowserSurface/\">Browser Surface demo</a></span></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIE10 in the Windows 8 Release Preview introduces <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh968249(v=vs.85).aspx\">gesture recognition objects</a> in JavaScript.\r\n\tSites can create gesture objects, decide which pointers (mouse, pen, or touch contacts) to process, and direct the gesture events at whatever element is desired.\r\n\tThe browser then calculates what gesture is being performed and notifies the page via events. This enables developers to build gesture experiences not yet natively\r\n\tpossible in any other browser. These include multiple concurrent gestures, for example, rotating two puzzle pieces with your hands.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLet’s take a look at how this works in code.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tCreating a Gesture Object</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe first step in handling gestures in your site is to instantiate a gesture object.</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n\t<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">var</span> myGesture = <span style=\"color: Blue;\">new</span> MSGesture();</code></p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNext, give the gesture a target element. This is the element to which the browser will fire gesture events. It’s also the element that determines the coordinate\r\n\tspace for the events.\r\n</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n\t<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>elm = document.getElementById(<span style=\"color: Maroon;\">&quot;someElement&quot;</span>);</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>myGesture.target = elm;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>elm.addEventListener(<span style=\"color: Maroon;\">&quot;MSGestureChange&quot;</span>, handleGesture);</code></p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFinally, tell the gesture object which pointers to process in its gesture recognition.\r\n</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n\t<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>elm.addEventListener(<span style=\"color: Maroon;\">&quot;MSPointerDown&quot;</span>, <span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span> (evt) {</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">// adds the current mouse, pen, or touch contact for gesture recognition</span></code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>myGesture.addPointer(evt.pointerId);</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>});</code></p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNote: don’t forget you need to use <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh772044(v=vs.85).aspx\"><code style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">–ms-touch-action</code></a>\r\n\tto <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2012/04/20/guidelines-for-building-touch-friendly-sites.aspx\">configure the element to not perform default touch</a>\r\n\tactions like panning and zooming, and instead provide pointer events for the input.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tHandling Gesture Events</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOnce a gesture object has a valid target and at least one pointer added to it, it will begin to fire gesture events. The gesture events come in 2 flavors: static\r\n\tgestures (like tap or hold) and dynamic gestures (like pinch, rotate, or swipe).</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n\tTap</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe most basic gesture recognition is a Tap. When a tap is detected, the <code>MSGestureTap</code> event is fired at the target element of the gesture object. Different\r\n\tfrom the click event, the tap gesture only fires when a user touches (or presses a mouse button, or touches a pen) down and up without moving. This is often useful\r\n\tif you want to differentiate between a user tapping on an element versus dragging the element.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n\tPress and Hold</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n\tA press and hold gesture happens when a user touches down with one finger, holds for a moment, and lifts without moving. During a press &amp; hold interaction,\r\n\tthe <code>MSGestureHold</code> event fires more than once for the various states of the gesture:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>element.addEventListener(<span style=\"color: Maroon;\">&quot;MSGestureHold&quot;</span>, handleHold);</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span> handleHold(evt) {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">if</span> (evt.detail &amp; evt.MSGESTURE_FLAG_BEGIN) {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><code><span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">// Begin signals the start of a gesture. For the Hold gesture, this means the user has been holding long enough in place that the gesture will become a complete press &amp; hold if the finger is lifted.</span></code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">if</span> (evt.detail &amp; evt.MSGESTURE_FLAG_END) {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><code><span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">// End signals the end of the gesture.</span></code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">if</span> (evt.detail &amp; evt.MSGESTURE_FLAG_CANCEL) {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><code><span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">// Cancel signals the user started the gesture but cancelled it. For hold, this occurs when the user drags away before lifting. This flag is sent together with the End flag, signaling the gesture recognition is complete.</span></code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h3>\r\n\tDynamic Gestures (pinch, rotate, swipe, and drag)</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDynamic gestures, like pinch or rotate, are reported in the form of transforms similar to CSS 2D Transforms. Three events are fired for dynamic gestures: <code>MSGestureStart</code>,\r\n\t<code>MSGestureChange</code> (fires repeatedly as the gesture continues), and <code>MSGestureEnd</code>. Each event contains <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh772076(v=vs.85).aspx\">\r\n\t\tinformation</a> about scale (pinch), rotation, translation, and velocity.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBecause dynamic gestures report transforms, it’s easy to use <code>MSGesture</code> with CSS 2D Transforms to manipulate an element like a photo or puzzle piece. For example, you\r\n\tcan enable scaling, rotating, and dragging of element as follows:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n\t<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>targetElement.addEventListener(<span style=\"color: Maroon;\">&quot;MSGestureChange&quot;</span>, manipulateElement);</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span> manipulateElement(e) {</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">// Uncomment the following code if you want to disable the built-in inertia provided by dynamic gesture recognition</span></code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">// if (e.detail == e.MSGESTURE_FLAG_INERTIA)</span></code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">// return;</span></code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 2em\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>&nbsp;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">var</span> m = <span style=\"color: Blue;\">new</span> MSCSSMatrix(e.target.style.transform); <span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">//\r\n\t\t\t\tGet the latest CSS transform on the element</span></code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>e.target.style.transform = m</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>.translate(e.offsetX, e.offsetY) <span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">// Move the transform origin under the center of the gesture</span></code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>.rotate(e.rotation * 180 / Math.PI) <span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">// Apply Rotation</span></code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>.scale(e.scale) <span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">// Apply Scale</span></code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>.translate(e.translationX, e.translationY) <span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">// Apply Translation</span></code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>.translate(-e.offsetX, -e.offsetY); <span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">// Move the transform origin back</span></code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>}</code></p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDynamic gestures like scale and rotate are supported with mouse by rotating the mouse wheel with the CTRL or SHIFT modifier keys, respectively.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tSummary</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIE10’s gesture events enable you to build touch experiences not currently possible in any other browser.

This situation also occurs for portrait mode on slate devices due to the smaller form factor.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the Metro style browser, the snapped view and portrait mode are auto-scaled by default to ensure at least 1024 pixels of layout width. Mobile devices take <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/iemobile/archive/2010/11/22/the-ie-mobile-viewport-on-windows-phone-7.aspx\">\r\n\t\ta similar approach</a> when displaying non-mobile-optimized sites on a narrow form factor.

In addition to fitting the site into a narrower region, this also may require\r\n\tchanges to image sizes, reordering of content, alternative tools for site navigation, or other fundamental changes to content.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIf your site has already made these modifications for narrow windows, then Device Adaptation can be used to override the default scale.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor some great examples of adaptive layouts, check out <a href=\"http://mediaqueri.es/\">Media Queries</a>. Metal Toad Media also has a great article discussing <a\r\n\t\thref=\"http://www.metaltoad.com/blog/simple-device-diagram-responsive-design-planning\">layout width support</a> based on prevalent devices and screen sizes in\r\n\tthe market.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tUsing @-ms-viewport</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<b>Simple support for the snapped view.</b> If your site is already capable of a 320 pixel width layout, you can easily choose to show that version in the snapped view. Combining\r\n\tDevice Adaptation with CSS media queries allows the auto-scaling feature to be overridden selectively. This CSS overrides the default auto-scaling, and instead\r\n\tenforces a consistent 320 pixel layout width for all windows 320 pixels wide or narrower:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n\t<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">@media</span> screen and (max-width: 320px) {</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">@-ms-viewport</span> { <span style=\"color: Red;\">width</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">320px</span>; }</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>}</code></p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen the window is less than 320 pixels wide the content will be scaled down to fit. For example, a 300 pixel wide window will show the content at 93.75%\r\n\tscale. For larger widths, IE10’s normal scaling applies (for example, when the Metro style browser is in portrait mode).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDevice adaptation degrades gracefully in browsers which do not yet support it. These browsers can still benefit from narrow layout support—they just won���t auto-scale\r\n\tto fit content to the window.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<b>Portrait support.</b> If your site supports a 768 pixel wide layout as well, then portrait mode support can be easily added with a second viewport rule:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n\t<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">@media</span> screen and (max-width: 320px) {</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">@-ms-viewport</span> { <span style=\"color: Red;\">width</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">320px</span>; }</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>}</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 2em\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>&nbsp;</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">@media</span> screen and (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 959px) {</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">@-ms-viewport</span> { <span style=\"color: Red;\">width</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">768px</span>; }</code></p>\r\n\t\t<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">\r\n\t\t\t<code>}</code></p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe recommend testing your site in layout widths of 768 pixels (portrait on most slates) and 320 pixels (snapped Metro style browser) in addition to 1024 pixels and wider (landscape).

66d6395b-f17a-bd3f-0939-cfecf03ddd57.description	"<p>In an <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2012/06/13/advances-in-javascript-performance-in-ie10-and-windows-8.aspx\">earlier post</a> we discussed JavaScript performance improvements introduced in IE10. Today we published <a href=\"http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/performance/bubbles/\">Bubbles</a>, originally inspired by Alex Gavriolov&rsquo;s simulation <a href=\"http://www.bubblemark.com/\">BubbleMark</a>, to explore some of these advances. The current version has been greatly expanded to take advantage of the new features of the Web platform and includes characteristics common to HTML5 games. In this post we peek under the hood to see how the demo is constructed and examine the main factors that affect its performance.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\"><img style=\"max-width: 95%; border: 1px solid #999; box-shadow: 3px 3px 8px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25);\" alt=\"Screen shot of Bubbles demo running in Metro style IE10 on the Windows 8 Release Preview\" src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/0841.uthb_2D00_image3.jpg\" /><br /> <span style=\"display: inline-block; padding-top: 4px;\"><a href=\"http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/performance/bubbles/\">Bubbles demo</a> running in Metro style IE10 on the Windows 8 Release Preview</span></p>\r\n<h2>The Structure of the Demo</h2>\r\n<p>The demo consists of a number of animated bubbles floating through space. At the core is a relatively simple JavaScript physics engine. On every animation frame, about 60 times per second, the physics engine recalculates the positions of all bubbles, adjusts the speed of each bubble by applying gravity, and computes collisions. All these computations involve intensive floating point math. Each bubble is represented on screen by a DOM image element to which a CSS transform is applied. The image is first translated around its origin, and then scaled dynamically to produce the effect of the bubble inflating. In JavaScript, every bubble is represented as an object with accessor properties, as introduced in ECMAScript 5.</p>\r\n<p>Behind the floating bubbles is a large image, which starts off occluded by a fully opaque mask rendered in a &lt;canvas&gt; element. Whenever two bubbles collide, a portion of the occluding mask is removed by applying a Gaussian filter to the mask&rsquo;s opacity component to produce a diffuse transparency effect. This process also involves many floating point multiplications, which are performed on elements of <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/12/01/working-with-binary-data-using-typed-arrays.aspx\"> Typed Arrays</a>, if supported by the browser.</p>\r\n<p>Over the floating bubbles rests a touch surface, which responds to touch input if supported by the running browser or mouse events if not. In response to touch simulated magnetic repulsion is applied to the floating bubbles scattering them around.</p>\r\n<h2>Efficient Animation</h2>\r\n<p>In IE10 we introduced support for the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-animation-timing-20110602/\">requestAnimationFrame</a> API. When building JavaScript applications with animation we continue to recommend using this API (instead of setTimeout or setInterval) on browsers that support it. As discussed in a <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/07/05/using-pc-hardware-more-efficiently-in-html5-new-web-performance-apis-part-1.aspx\"> previous post</a> exploring how to make the most of your hardware, this API allows you to achieve maximum frame rate supported by the available display while avoiding excessive work that would remain invisible to the user. By doing the minimal number of operations to deliver the best user experience, you can save battery power. IE10 Release Preview <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2012/06/06/moving-the-stable-web-forward-in-ie10-release-preview.aspx\">supports this API</a> without vendor prefix, but the prefixed version is also maintained for compatibility with earlier IE10 preview releases. The Bubbles demo uses this API and falls back to setTimeout when it is not available.</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>Demo.prototype.requestAnimationFrame = <span style=\"color: blue;\">function</span> () {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">var</span> that = <span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">if</span> (window.requestAnimationFrame)</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.animationFrameTimer =</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 10em;\"><code>window.requestAnimationFrame(<span style=\"color: blue;\">function</span> () { that.onAnimationFrame(); });</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">else</span></code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.animationFrameTimer =</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 10em;\"><code>setTimeout(<span style=\"color: blue;\">function</span> () { that.onAnimationFrame(); }, <span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.animationFrameDuration);</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 2em;\"><code>&nbsp;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>Demo.prototype.cancelAnimationFrame = <span style=\"color: blue;\">function</span> () {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">if</span> (window.cancelAnimationFrame)</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><code>window.cancelAnimationFrame(<span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.animationFrameTimer);</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">else</span></code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><code>clearTimeout(<span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.animationFrameTimer);</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2>Converting DOM Values from Strings to Numbers</h2>\r\n<p>JavaScript is very flexible and includes a range of automatic conversions between values of different types. For example, string values are automatically converted to number values when used in arithmetic operations. In modern browsers, this convenience may come at a surprisingly high performance cost. Type specialized code emitted by state-of-the-art JavaScript compilers is very efficient in arithmetic on values of known types, but incurs very high overhead when it encounters values of unexpected types.</p>\r\n<p>When the Bubbles demo is loaded, the <code>numberOfBubbles</code> property starts off with a value of 100. On every animation frame, the position of each bubble is adjusted:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">function</span> Demo() {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.numberOfBubbles = 100;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: #006400;\">//...</span></code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 2em;\"><code>&nbsp;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>Demo.prototype.moveBubbles = <span style=\"color: blue;\">function</span>(elapsedTime) {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">for</span> (<span style=\"color: blue;\">var</span> i = 0; i &lt; <span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.numberOfBubbles; i++) {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.bubbles[i].move(elapsedTime, <span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.gravity);</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>When the user selects a different value in the UI, the value of the <code>numberOfBubbles</code> property must be adjusted accordingly. A straightforward event handler may do it like this:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>Demo.prototype.onNumberOfBubblesChange = <span style=\"color: blue;\">function</span> () {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.numberOfBubbles = document.getElementById(<span style=\"color: maroon;\">\"numberOfBubblesSelector\"</span>).value;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: #006400;\">//...</span></code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>This seemingly natural way of reading the user&rsquo;s input results in about 10% overhead in the JavaScript portion of the demo. Because the value obtained from the drop down and assigned to <code>numberOfBubbles</code> is a string (not a number), it has to be converted to a number on every iteration of the <code>moveBubbles</code> loop for every frame of the animation.</p>\r\n<p>This demonstrates that it&rsquo;s a good practice to explicitly convert values extracted from the DOM to numbers <i>before</i> using them in arithmetic operations. Values of DOM properties are typically of type string in JavaScript and the automatic string to number conversions can be quite expensive when done repeatedly. A better way to update <code>numberOfBubbles</code> based on user selection, as found in the demo, is as follows:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>Demo.prototype.onNumberOfBubblesChange = <span style=\"color: blue;\">function</span> () {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.numberOfBubbles = parseInt(document.getElementById(<span style=\"color: maroon;\">\"numberOfBubblesSelector\"</span>).value);</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: #006400;\">//...</span></code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2>Working with ES5 Accessor Properties</h2>\r\n<p>ECMAScript 5 accessor properties are a convenient mechanism for data encapsulation, computed properties, data validation, or change notification.

When working with floating point numbers it is advantageous to use Typed Arrays (Float32Array or Float64Array) instead of JavaScript arrays (Array). JavaScript arrays can hold elements of any type, but typically require that floating point values be allocated on the heap (boxing) before being added to the array. This affects performance. To achieve consistently high performance on modern browsers use Float32Array or Float64Array to indicate the intent of storing floating point values. Doing so you help the JavaScript engine avoid heap boxing and turn on other compiler optimizations, like generating type specialized operations.</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>BubbleTank.prototype.generateOcclusionMask = <span style=\"color: blue;\">function</span>() {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">if</span> (<span style=\"color: blue;\">typeof</span> Float64Array != <span style=\"color: maroon;\">\"undefined\"</span>) {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.occlusionMask = <span style=\"color: blue;\">new</span> Float64Array(<span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.canvasWidth * <span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.canvasHeight);</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code>} <span style=\"color: blue;\">else</span> {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.occlusionMask = <span style=\"color: blue;\">new</span> Array(<span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.canvasWidth * <span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.canvasHeight);</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.resetOcclusionMask();</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>The example above shows how the Bubbles demo uses Float64Arrays to hold and update the occlusion mask applied to the canvas hiding the background image. If the browser doesn&rsquo;t support Typed Arrays, the code falls back on regular arrays. The gains from using Type Arrays in the Bubbles demo vary with settings. In a medium-sized window in IE10, Typed Arrays improve the overall frame rate by around 10%.</p>\r\n<h2>Summary</h2>\r\n<p>In this blog post we explored the newly published Bubbles demo and examined how it takes advantage of dramatic gains in JavaScript execution the IE10 Release Preview. We shared a few important techniques to achieve good performance in animation-based applications.

Windows 8 includes one HTML5 browsing engine that powers both browsing experiences (Metro style and desktop) as well as Metro\r\n\tstyle applications that use HTML5 and JavaScript. The release preview represents a major revision of the same modern JavaScript engine, Chakra, which first debuted\r\n\twith IE9. With each platform preview we make progress against our goals to create an engine that delivers great performance on the Web while ensuring that it is\r\n\thighly compatible, interoperable, and secure. This post will explore how the JavaScript engine has been enhanced to deliver great performance for emerging Web application\r\n\tscenarios.\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tPerformance for Real Web Applications</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWeb applications have been evolving rapidly in recent years. A decade ago the Web consisted primarily of Web sites with static content, like what you may encounter\r\n\tin a <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/\">blog</a>, a <a href=\"http://www.alwaysfreshgoodness.com/\">small</a> <a href=\"http://totokaelo.com/\">business</a> landing\r\n\tpage, or on <a href=\"http://www.wikipedia.org/\">Wikipedia</a>. The emergence of AJAX helped spawn more complex and interactive sites like what you see on <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com\">\r\n\t\tFacebook</a> or <a href=\"http://www.jetsetter.com/\">JetSetter</a>. Subsequent advances in performance allowed for large and complex applications to be created,\r\n\tsuch as <a href=\"http://1263974.r.msn.com/?ld=4vIua1S_hstxxIgu4bLH1zvR9AcSvkbb4f6awqeSajhpqnmwjBxg0ImvUDzhsPXYhsJh3LVIAsK-d88KVSxUu1Yv6DfWsQZPwKVZOu7teP0Z9SqYgFtcEdwXF7qtIbOxJ0qVAyJYIs_pYT7P7uMRjtp_ndnaUagsGPEH8vjEbYMwLkxOdV6D0ZoCF9ebr2rY7vq0KoXtN-UXu-306O2bzOCQ_bwRfG0CQe_2CAOx9a4QKogNmGQeKsUkfNw_l-GQ9s3xas5_c4bGTP62QRJgxOaf0bQQFmOrKkAr7K7zYPc66Q0TB7OApP1bh9T9s9LCpn37sJK4lSaA0GmgwYsk6qADqEl7CH2ArfnMsW1vEmAYg2O5lQQowjlUGMkCYBZkMVnlmQ59MLKAv9p4CemuE-ieoBtiMVmwZE4IgGVJAaawxjpspaj0xFuctgnuofHt69iZrWVmrUudjR5EDYMCPRSE9HTATFxpqP4qXI9AemDxqDxEJOVmMV4fKcb_vX-04UKKBcPBAmY3M95k4NcR4qGYx6yaSeuFaJVf4rEqYNjFjZtor7mTcP27U\">\r\n\t\tOffice 365</a>, <a href=\"http://maps.bing.com/\">Bing Maps</a>, etc. Most recently, the expansion of the W3C standard APIs, gains in JavaScript performance,\r\n\tand hardware accelerated graphics made building even sophisticated games on the Web possible, for example, <a href=\"http://chrome.angrybirds.com/\">Angry Birds</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pirateslovedaisies.com/\">Pirates Love Daisies</a>,\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.cuttherope.ie/\">Cut The Rope</a>, etc.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\">\r\n\t<img style=\"max-width: 95%;\" alt=\"Diagram showing spectrum of Web pages and their performance characteristics. On the left are Basic Web Pages where Page Load Time is the driving performance goal. On the right are Web Applications, HTML5 Games, and Windows 8 Metro style apps where JavaScript Execution Speed, DOM Interactions, and Accelerated graphics have the biggest impact on performance.\"\r\n\t\tsrc=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/3286.aijpiiaw_2D00_image3_5F00_760x299.PNG\" /></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAs applications evolve, the performance factors affecting user experience change. For traditional Web sites, initial page load determines how quickly the user can\r\n\tsee the content. Interactive Web sites and large Web applications may be gated by the efficiency of DOM operations, CSS processing, and manipulation of large internal\r\n\tstate in memory. HTML5 games often depend on fast canvas rendering, JavaScript execution and efficient garbage collection. In short, browser performance is a complex\r\n\tproblem, which requires taking into account the needs of a broad spectrum of diverse applications.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn this post we fill focus on performance of only one browser subsystem, the JavaScript engine. With recent gains in JavaScript performance, for many Web applications\r\n\tJavaScript execution is no longer a limiting factor. On the other hand, as performance increases, new scenarios emerge that place additional demands on the JavaScript\r\n\tengine. We continually look for opportunities to evolve Chakra to match performance requirements of real JavaScript-intensive applications.\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\">\r\n\t<img style=\"max-width: 95%; padding-bottom: 8px;\" alt=\"Two dimension chart showing screen shots of various sites plotted on two axis: Use of Other Browser Components (Y) and JavaScript Execution (X).

This involves deferring as much work as possible until absolutely necessary, avoiding\r\n\t\twork altogether, making use of periods of inactivity, and parallelizing work to minimize impact on the responsiveness of the application.<br />\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Take advantage of all available hardware. This translates to utilizing all available CPU cores, as well as generating advanced specialized CPU instructions, for example, \r\n\t\tIntel’s SSE2, if available.<br />\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\">\r\n\t<img style=\"max-width: 95%;\" alt=\"Diagram illustrating the Chakra JavaScript engine&#39;s use of two processor cores.\" src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/6232.aijpiiaw_2D00_image5_5F00_760x317.PNG\" /><br />\r\n\tChakra’s Parallel Architecture</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tChakra, though only one of the browser subsystems – is itself comprised of several components which work together to process and execute JavaScript code. When the\r\n\tbrowser downloads a JavaScript file it hands its content over to Chakra’s parser to verify its syntactical correctness. This is the only operation that applies\r\n\tto the entire file. Subsequent steps are performed individually on each function (including the global function). As a function is about to be executed (the global\r\n\tfunction is run immediately after parsing) Chakra’s parser builds an abstract syntax tree (AST) representation of the code, and hands it off to the bytecode generator,\r\n\twhich produces an intermediate form (bytecode) suitable for execution by the interpreter (but not directly by the CPU). Both the AST and the function bytecode are\r\n\tpreserved so they don’t need to be recreated on subsequent executions. The interpreter is then invoked to run the function. As the interpreter executes individual\r\n\toperations it collects information (a profile) about the types of inputs it encounters and keeps track of how many times the function was called.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAs the number of calls reaches certain threshold, the interpreter queues the function up for compilation. Unlike in other browsers, Chakra’s just-in-time (JIT)\r\n\tcompiler runs on a separate dedicated thread and thus does not interfere with script execution. The sole job of the compiler is to generate optimized machine instructions\r\n\tfor each function in the compilation queue. Once a function is compiled, the availability of the machine code is signaled to the main script thread. Upon the next\r\n\tinvocation, the entry point to the function is redirected to the newly compiled machine code and execution proceeds directly on the CPU. It’s important to note that\r\n\tfunctions that are called only once or twice never actually get compiled, which saves time and resources.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJavaScript is a managed runtime in that memory management is hidden from the developer and performed by an automatic garbage collector, which runs periodically\r\n\tto clean up any objects that are no longer in use. Chakra employs a conservative, quasi-generational, mark and sweep, garbage collector that does most of its work\r\n\tconcurrently on a dedicated thread to minimize script execution pauses that would interrupt the user experience.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis architecture allows Chakra to start executing JavaScript code almost immediately during page load. On the other hand, during periods of intense JavaScript\r\n\tactivity, Chakra can parallelize work and saturate up to three CPU cores by running script, compiling and collecting garbage at the same time.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tFast Page Load Time</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEven relatively static Web sites tend to use JavaScript for interactivity, advertising, or social sharing. In fact, the volume of JavaScript included in <a href=\"http://www.alexa.com/topsites\">\r\n\t\tAlexa’s top 1 million pages</a> has been steadily increasing, as reported by <a href=\"http://httparchive.org/index.php\">Steve Souders’ HTTP Archive</a>.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\">\r\n\t<img style=\"max-width: 95%; padding-bottom: 8px;\" alt=\"Chart showing volume of JavaScript in Alexa’s Top 1 Million Pages\" src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/5153.aijpiiaw_2D00_image6_5F00_598x295.png\" /><br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://httparchive.org/trends.php?s=All&amp;minlabel=Dec+28+2010&amp;maxlabel=May+15+2012#bytesJS&amp;reqJS\">Volume of JavaScript in Alexa’s Top 1 Million\r\n\t\tPages</a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe JavaScript code included in these Web sites must be processed by the browser’s JavaScript engine and the global function of each script file must be executed\r\n\tbefore the content can be fully rendered. Consequently, it is crucial that the amount of work performed on this critical path be minimized. Chakra’s parser and\r\n\tbytecode interpreter were designed with this objective in mind.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\r\n\t<b>Bytecode Interpreter.</b> JavaScript code executed during page load often performs initialization and setup that is executed only once. To minimize the overall\r\n\tpage load time it is imperative to start executing this code immediately – without waiting for a just-in-time compiler to process the code and emit machine instructions.\r\n\tThe interpreter starts running JavaScript code as soon as it is translated into bytecode. To further reduce the time to first executed instruction, Chakra processes\r\n\tand emits bytecode only for functions that are about to be executed using a mechanism called deferred parsing.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<b>Deferred Parsing.</b> <img style=\"padding: 8px 0 8px 12px; float: right;\" alt=\"Chart showing the fraction of code executed in 11 popular Web sites. The amount ranges from a little over 30% to a little over 50%.\"\r\n\t\tsrc=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/7416.aijpiiaw_2D00_image7_5F00_300x249.png\" />The <a href=\"http://www.research.microsoft.com/JSMeter\">JSMeter</a> project from Microsoft Research showed that typical Web pages use only a fraction\r\n\tof code that they download – generally on the order of 40-50% (see chart to right). Intuitively, this makes sense: developers often include popular JavaScript libraries like <a href=\"http://jquery.com/\">\r\n\t\tjQuery</a> or <a href=\"http://dojotoolkit.org/\">dojo</a> or custom ones like those used in Office 365, but only leverage a fraction of the functionality the\r\n\tlibrary supports.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo optimize such scenarios, Chakra performs only the most basic syntax-only parsing of the source code. The rest of the work (building the abstract syntax tree\r\n\tand generating bytecode) is performed one function at a time only when the function is about to be invoked. This strategy not only helps with the responsiveness\r\n\tof the browser when loading Web pages, but also reduces the memory footprint.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn IE9 there was one limitation of Chakra’s deferred parsing. Functions nested inside other functions had to be parsed immediately with their enclosing functions.\r\n\tThis restriction proved important because many JavaScript libraries employ the so called “<a href=\"http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/04/22/the-module-pattern-in-a-nutshell/\">module\r\n\t\tpattern</a>,” in which most of the library’s code is enclosed in a large function which is immediately executed. In IE10 we removed this restriction and Chakra\r\n\tnow defers parsing and bytecode generation of any function that is not immediately executed.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"clear:both;\">\r\n\tPerformance Improvements for JavaScript-Intensive Applications</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn IE10, as in IE9 before, we strive to improve the performance of real Web applications. However, Web applications depend on JavaScript performance to a varying\r\n\tdegree. To discuss the enhancements in IE10 it’s most useful to focus on those applications which are JavaScript-intensive; where improvements in Chakra yield substantial\r\n\tperformance gains. An important class of JavaScript-intensive applications includes HTML5 games and simulations.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAt the onset of IE10 we analyzed a sample of popular JavaScript games (for example, <a href=\"http://chrome.angrybirds.com/\">Angry Birds</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cuttherope.ie/\">\r\n\t\tCut the Rope</a>, or <a href=\"http://playtankworld.com/\">Tankworld</a>) and simulations (for example, <a href=\"http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Performance/FishIETank/Default.html\">\r\n\t\t\tFishIE Tank</a>, <a href=\"http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Performance/FishBowl/\">HTML5 Fish Bowl</a>, <a href=\"http://mrdoob.com/projects/chromeexperiments/ball_pool/\">\r\n\t\t\t\tBall Pool</a>, <a href=\"http://jarrodoverson.com/static/demos/particleSystem/\">Particle System</a>) to understand what performance improvements would\r\n\thave the most significant impact on the user experience. Our analysis revealed a number of common characteristics and coding patterns. All of the applications are driven\r\n\tby a high frequency timer callback. Most of them use canvas for rendering, but some rely on animating DOM elements, and some use a combination of the two. In most\r\n\tapplications at least portions of the code are written in the object oriented style – either in application code or in included libraries (for example, <a href=\"http://box2d-js.sourceforge.net/\">\r\n\t\tBox2d.js</a>). Short functions are common, as are frequent property reads and writes, and polymorphism. All of the applications perform floating point arithmetic\r\n\tand many allocate a fair amount of memory putting pressure on the garbage collector. These common patterns became the focus of our performance work in IE10. The\r\n\tfollowing sections describe the changes we’ve made in response.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tJust-in-Time Compiler – Reconsidered and Improved</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIE10 includes substantial improvements to Chakra’s JIT compiler. We added support for two additional processor architectures: x64 and ARM. That’s why, whether your\r\n\tJavaScript application is experienced by the user on a 64-bit PC or an ARM-based tablet, it enjoys the benefits of executing directly on the CPU.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe also changed the fundamental approach to generating machine code. JavaScript is a very dynamic language, which limits how much a compiler can know when generating\r\n\tcode. For example, when compiling the function below, the compiler doesn’t know the shape (property layout) of the objects involved or types of their properties.</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span> compute(v, w) {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">return</span> v.x + w.y;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn IE9 Chakra’s compiler generated code that located every property at runtime and handled all plausible operations (in the example above: integer addition, floating\r\n\tpoint addition, or even string concatenation). Some of these operations were handled directly in machine code, while others required help from Chakra’s runtime.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn IE10, the JIT compiler generates profile-based, type-specialized machine code. In other words, it generates machine code that is tailored to objects of a particular\r\n\tshape and values of a particular type. To emit the right code the compiler needs to know what types of input values to expect. Because JavaScript is a dynamic language,\r\n\tthis information is not available in the source code. We enhanced Chakra’s interpreter to collect it at runtime, a technique we call dynamic profiling. When a function\r\n\tis scheduled for JIT compilation, the compiler examines the runtime profile gathered by the interpreter and emits code tailored to the expected inputs.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The interpreter gathers information for the runs it observes, but it’s possible that the execution of the program will lead to runtime values which violate assumptions \r\n\tmade in the generated optimized code. For every assumption it makes, the compiler emits a runtime check.  If a later execution results in an unexpected value, the check \r\n\tfails, execution bails out of the specialized machine code, and is continued in the interpreter. The reason for bailout (the failed check) is recorded, additional profile \r\n\tinformation is collected by the interpreter, and the function is recompiled with different assumptions.  Bailout and re-compilation are two fundamentally new capabilities\r\n\tin IE10.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe net effect is that Chakra’s IE10 compiler generates fewer machine instructions for your code, reducing the overall memory footprint and speeding up execution.\r\n\tThis particularly impacts apps with floating point arithmetic and object property access, like the HTML5 games and simulations we previously discussed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIf you write JavaScript code in the object oriented style, your code will also benefit from Chakra’s support for function inlining. Object oriented code commonly\r\n\tcontains a large proportion of relatively small methods, for which the overhead of the function call is significant compared to the execution time of the function.\r\n\tFunction inlining allows Chakra to reduce this overhead, but more importantly it greatly expands the scope of other traditional compiler optimizations, such as\r\n\tloop invariant code motion or copy propagation.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tFaster Floating Point Arithmetic</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMost JavaScript programs perform some amount of integer arithmetic. As the example below illustrates, even in programs that don’t focus primarily on arithmetic,\r\n\tinteger values are commonly used as iteration variables in loops or as indices into arrays.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span> findString(s, a) {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">for</span> (<span style=\"color: Blue;\">var</span> i = 0, al = a.length; i &lt; al; i++) {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">if</span> (a[i] == s) <span style=\"color: Blue;\">return</span> i;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">return</span> -1;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFloating point math, on the other hand, is typically restricted to certain classes of applications such as games, simulations, sound, image or video processing,\r\n\tetc. Historically, few such applications were written in JavaScript, but recent advances in browser performance have made JavaScript implementations viable. In\r\n\tIE9 we optimized Chakra for the more common integer operations. In IE10 we dramatically improved floating point math.</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span> compute(a, b, c, d) {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">return</span> (a + b) * (c &#8722; d);</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGiven a simple function above a JavaScript compiler cannot determine the types of arguments a, b, c and d from the source code. The IE9 compiler would assume that\r\n\tthe arguments were likely to be integer numbers and generate fast integer machine instructions. This worked very well if during execution the arguments were, indeed,\r\n\tintegers. If floating point numbers were used instead, the code had to rely on much slower helper functions in Chakra’s runtime. The overhead of function calls\r\n\twas further exacerbated by boxing and unboxing of intermediate values on the heap (in most 32-bit JavaScript engines, including Chakra, individual floating point\r\n\tvalues must be allocated on the heap). In the expression above the result of each operation required a heap allocation, followed by storing the value on the heap,\r\n\tand then retrieval of the value from the heap for the next operation.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn IE10, the compiler takes advantage of the profile information collected by the interpreter to generate dramatically faster floating point code. In the example\r\n\tabove, if the profile indicates that all arguments are likely to be floating point numbers, the compiler will emit floating point machine instructions. The entire\r\n\texpression will be computed in just three machine instructions (assuming all arguments are already in registers), all intermediate values will be stored in registers,\r\n\tand only one heap allocation will be required to return the final result.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor floating point intensive applications this is a massive performance gain. Experiments show that in IE10 floating point operations execute about 50% faster than\r\n\tin IE9. In addition, the reduced rate of memory allocation means fewer garbage collections.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tFaster Objects and Property Access</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJavaScript objects are a convenient and broadly used mechanism for grouping logically related sets of values. Whether you’re using JavaScript objects in a structured\r\n\tobject oriented programming style or merely as flexible packaging for values, your code will greatly benefit from the improvements in object allocation and property\r\n\taccess performance added in IE10.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAs mentioned earlier, efficient property access is complicated in JavaScript because the shape of an object isn’t known during compilation. JavaScript objects can\r\n\tbe created ad hoc without a predefined type or class. New properties can be added to (or even removed from) objects on the fly and in any order. As a result, when\r\n\tcompiling the following method, the compiler doesn’t know where to find the values of properties x, y, and z on the Vector object.\r\n</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>Vector.prototype.magnitude = <span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span>() {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">return</span> Math.sqrt(<span style=\"color: Blue;\">this</span>.x * <span style=\"color: Blue;\">this</span>.x + <span style=\"color: Blue;\">this</span>.y * <span style=\"color: Blue;\">this</span>.y + <span style=\"color: Blue;\">this</span>.z * <span style=\"color: Blue;\">this</span>.z);</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn IE9 we introduced inline caches which greatly speed up access to properties. Inline caches remember the shape of the object and the location in the object’s\r\n\tmemory where a given property can be found. Inline caches can remember only one object shape and work well if all objects a function works with are of the same\r\n\tshape. In IE10 we added a secondary caching mechanism which improves performance of code operating on objects of different shapes (polymorphic).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBefore a property value can be read the compiler must verify that the object’s shape matches that stored in the inline cache. To do that, in IE9, the compiler\r\n\tgenerates a runtime shape check before every property access. Because programs often read or write multiple properties of the same object in close succession (as\r\n\tin the example below), all these checks add overhead.</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span> collide(b1, b2) {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">var</span> dx = b1.x - b2.x;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">var</span> dy = b1.y - b2.y;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">var</span> dvx = b1.vx - b2.vx;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">var</span> dvy = b1.vy - b2.vy;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">var</span> distanceSquare = (dx * dx + dy * dy) || 1.0;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">//...</span></code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn IE10, Chakra generates code tailored to the expected object shape. Through careful symbol tracking combined with bailout and re-compilation capabilities the\r\n\tnew compiler dramatically reduces the number of runtime shape checks performed. In the example above, instead of 8 separate shape checks, only 2 are done, one each\r\n\tfor b1 and b2. In addition, once the shape of an object has been established, all property locations are known, and read or write operations are as efficient as\r\n\tin C++.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn ECMAScript 5 objects may contain a new kind of properties, called accessor properties. Accessor properties differ from traditional data properties in that custom\r\n\tget and set functions are invoked to handle the read and write operations. Accessor properties are a convenient mechanism for adding data encapsulation, computed\r\n\tproperties, data validation, or change notification. Chakra’s internal type system and inline caches were designed to accommodate accessor properties and facilitate\r\n\tefficient reading and writing of their values.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIf you write an HTML5 game or animation, you often need a physics engine which performs computation required to produce realistic movement of objects under the\r\n\tforce of gravity, simulate collisions, etc. For very simple physics, you may build your own engine, but for a more complex requirements, you would typically use\r\n\tone of the popular physics libraries now available in JavaScript, such as <a href=\"http://box2d-js.sourceforge.net/\">Box2d.js</a> (ported from <a href=\"http://box2d.org/\">\r\n\t\tBox2d</a>). These libraries often use small objects, such as Point, Vector or Color. On every animation frame a large number of these objects are created and\r\n\tpromptly discarded. Therefore, it’s important that the JavaScript runtime create objects efficiently.\r\n</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: Black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">var</span> Vector = <span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span>(x, y, z) {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">this</span>.x = x;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">this</span>.y = y;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">this</span>.z = z;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 2em\"><code>&nbsp;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>Vector.prototype = {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">//...</span></code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code>normalize : <span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span>() {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">var</span> m = Math.sqrt((<span style=\"color: Blue;\">this</span>.x * <span style=\"color: Blue;\">this</span>.x) + (<span style=\"color: Blue;\">this</span>.y * <span style=\"color: Blue;\">this</span>.y) + (<span style=\"color: Blue;\">this</span>.z * <span style=\"color: Blue;\">this</span>.z));</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">return</span> <span style=\"color: Blue;\">new</span> Vector(<span style=\"color: Blue;\">this</span>.x / m, <span style=\"color: Blue;\">this</span>.y / m, <span style=\"color: Blue;\">this</span>.z / m);</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code>},</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 2em\"><code>&nbsp;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code>add : <span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span>(v, w) {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">return</span> <span style=\"color: Blue;\">new</span> Vector(w.x + v.x, w.y + v.y, w.z + v.z);</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code>},</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 2em\"><code>&nbsp;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code>cross : <span style=\"color: Blue;\">function</span>(v, w) {</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><code><span style=\"color: Blue;\">return</span> <span style=\"color: Blue;\">new</span> Vector(-v.z * w.y + v.y * w.z, v.z * w.x - v.x * w.z, -v.y * w.x + v.x * w.y);</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code>},</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><code><span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">//...</span></code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code>}</code></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn IE10, the internal layout of JavaScript objects is optimized to streamline object creation. In IE9 every object consisted of a fixed-size header and an expandable\r\n\tproperty array. The latter is necessary to accommodate additional properties that may be added after the object has been created. Not all JavaScript applications\r\n\texploit this flexibility, and objects often receive most of their properties at construction. This trait allows Chakra to allocate most of the properties for such\r\n\tobjects directly with the header, which results in only one memory allocation (instead of two) for every newly created object. This change also reduces the number\r\n\tof memory dereferences required to read or write the object’s property, and improves register utilization. Improved object layout and fewer runtime shape checks\r\n\tresult in up to 50% faster property access.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tGarbage Collection Enhancements</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAs discussed above, HTML5 games and animations often create and discard objects at a very high rate. JavaScript programs don’t explicitly destroy discarded objects\r\n\tand reclaim memory. Instead, they rely on the engine’s garbage collector to periodically reclaim memory occupied by unused objects to make room for new ones. Automatic\r\n\tgarbage collection makes programming easier, but typically requires JavaScript execution to pause every now and then for the collector to do its work. If the collector\r\n\ttakes a long time to run, the whole browser may become unresponsive. In HTML5 games, even short pauses (tens of milliseconds) are disruptive because they are perceptible\r\n\tby the user as glitches in animation.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn IE10 we made a number of enhancements to our memory allocator and garbage collector. We already discussed object layout changes and generation of machine code\r\n\tspecialized for floating point arithmetic, which result in fewer memory allocations. In addition, Chakra now allocates leaf objects (for example, numbers and strings) from\r\n\ta separate memory space. Leaf objects don’t hold pointers to other objects, so they don’t require as much attention during garbage collection as regular objects.\r\n\tAllocating leaf objects from a separate space has two advantages. First, this entire space can be skipped during the mark phase, which reduces its duration. Second,\r\n\tduring concurrent collection, new allocations from the leaf object space don’t require rescanning affected pages. Because Chakra’s collector works concurrently\r\n\twith the main script thread, the running script may modify or create new objects on pages that have already been processed. To make sure such objects aren’t prematurely\r\n\tcollected, Chakra write-protects pages before the mark phase starts. Pages that have been written to during the mark phase must be later rescanned on the main script\r\n\tthread. Because leaf objects don’t require such processing, pages from the leaf object space don’t need to be write-protected or rescanned later. This saves precious\r\n\ttime on the main script thread, reducing pauses. HTML5 games and animations benefit significantly from this change, because they often work heavily with floating point\r\n\tnumbers and devote much of the allocated memory to heap-boxed numbers.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen the user interacts directly with a Web application, it is critical that the application’s code be executed as fast as possible, ideally without interruptions\r\n\tfor garbage collection. However, when the user switches away from the browser, or even just changes tabs, it is important to reduce the memory footprint of the\r\n\tnow inactive site or application. That’s why in IE9 Chakra triggered collection upon exiting JavaScript code if enough memory has been allocated. This worked well\r\n\tfor most applications, but proved problematic for applications driven by high frequency timers, such as HTML5 games and animations. For such applications collections\r\n\twere triggered too frequently and resulted in dropped frames and overall degradation of the user experience. Perhaps the most apparent manifestation of this problem\r\n\twas the <a href=\"http://www.playtankworld.com/\">Tankworld</a> game, but other HTML5 simulations also exhibited pauses in animation induced by frequent garbage collections.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn IE10 we solved this problem by coordinating garbage collections with the rest of the browser. Chakra now delays the garbage collection at the end of script execution\r\n\tand requests a callback from the browser after an interval of script inactivity. If the interval elapses before any script executes, Chakra starts a collection,\r\n\totherwise collection is further postponed. This technique permits us to shrink memory footprint when the browser (or one of its tabs) becomes inactive, while at\r\n\tthe same time greatly reducing frequency of collections in animation-driven applications.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCombined, these changes reduced the time spent in garbage collection on the main thread by an average factor of four on the HTML5 simulations measured. As a proportion\r\n\tof JavaScript execution time, garbage collection dropped from around 27% to about 6%.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tSummary\r\n</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIE10 achieves dramatic performance gains for JavaScript-intensive applications, particularly HTML5 games and simulations. These gains were accomplished through\r\n\ta range of important improvements in Chakra: from new fundamental capabilities of the JIT compiler to changes in the garbage collector.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAs we wrap up development on IE10 we celebrate the progress we’ve made, but we are keenly aware that performance is a perpetual quest. New applications emerge almost\r\n\tdaily that test the limits of modern browsers and their JavaScript engines. Without a doubt there will be plenty to work on in the next release!</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIf you’re a JavaScript developer, we’d love to hear from you.

Many of you shared feedback that you&rsquo;d like to provide higher-resolution visuals to better depict your site brand on your users&rsquo; pinned site tiles. In <a href=\"http://preview.windows.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Windows 8 Release Preview</a>, you can to do that: we&rsquo;ve added the ability for you to provide a PNG tile image and specify the tile&rsquo;s background color.</p>\r\n<h3>Example</h3>\r\n<p>Below are examples of a pinned site tile using the site&rsquo;s favicon and automatically determined color (left) and high-resolution PNG with custom tile color (right):</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\"><img alt=\"Default tile for the Fresh Tweets demo\" src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/7317.FreshTweetsDefault.png\" /><img style=\"margin-left: 2em;\" alt=\"Tile for Fresh Tweets demo following @BenThePCGuy\" src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/0385.BenThePCGuy.png\" /></p>\r\n<h3>Markup</h3>\r\n<p><code>Meta</code> tags specify the tile&rsquo;s image and background color. Example:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">&lt;</span><span style=\"color: maroon;\">meta</span> <span style=\"color: red;\">name</span><span style=\"color: blue;\">=\"msapplication-TileImage\"</span> <span style=\"color: red;\">content</span><span style=\"color: blue;\">=\"images/benthepcguy-144.png\"/&gt;</span></code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: blue;\">&lt;</span><span style=\"color: maroon;\">meta</span> <span style=\"color: red;\">name</span><span style=\"color: blue;\">=\"msapplication-TileColor\"</span> <span style=\"color: red;\">content</span><span style=\"color: blue;\">=\"#d83434\"/&gt;</span></code></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Tile images must be square PNGs 144px by 144px. For best results, we recommend using a transparent background, not a background that matches the tile&rsquo;s color. The tile color can be specified as a hex RGB color using CSS&rsquo;s <code>#rrggbb</code> notation, via CSS color names, or by the CSS <code>rgb()</code> function.</p>\r\n<p>See this behavior in action on our updated <a href=\"http://ietestdrive2.com/pinnedsites/\" target=\"_blank\">Fresh Tweets demo</a>.</p>\r\n<p><b>Note:</b> IE10 only downloads the tile image when the user pins the site to his or her Start screen so sites don&rsquo;t incur additional bandwidth costs.</p>\r\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\r\n<p>Internet Explorer 10 enables Web developers to create high-quality site-centric visuals for pinned site tiles, allowing sites&rsquo; brands to be better reflected on the Windows 8 Start screen and look more visually integrated with the rest of the app and content tiles. Developers need provide only one high-quality icon that Windows 8 will scale as needed for devices running at different resolutions.</p>\r\n<p>Sites can also share notifications and offer jump lists for quickly navigating around the site.

In particular, we looked for those specifications that:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"margin-top:0;\">\r\n<li>Are stable, that is, there were no recent additions or changes and no renaming or major changes are expected;</li>\r\n<li>Are supported by at least two browsers other than IE10;</li>\r\n<li>Are interoperable across all these browsers for the features’ core use cases;</li>\r\n<li>Are already used on the Web, including in their unprefixed form; and</li>\r\n<li>Reached Candidate Recommendation since Windows 8 Consumer Preview or are likely to become Candidate Recommendations in 2012.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:0;\">The following W3C draft standard features match these criteria and <b><i>IE10 now supports them in their unprefixed form</i></b>:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"margin-top:0;\">\r\n<li>Gradients (<a href=\"http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-images/#gradients\">CSS Image Values and Replaced Content</a>)</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-animations/\">CSS Animations</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-transitions/\">CSS Transitions</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-transforms/\">CSS Transforms</a></li>\r\n<li><code>font-feature-settings</code> property (<a href=\"http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-fonts/\">CSS Fonts</a>)</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/\">Indexed Database API</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/animation-timing/\">Timing control for script-based animations</a> (requestAnimationFrame)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>For compatibility with sites and apps developed using the Windows 8 Consumer Preview, IE10 <i>also</i> supports these standards in their vendor-prefixed form using the Microsoft vendor prefixes (<code>&#8209;ms&#8209;/ms</code>).</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:0;\">IE10 also supports the following W3C draft standards in vendor-prefixed form. We believe these drafts do not yet meet the criteria listed above:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"margin-top:0;\">\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-flexbox/\">CSS Flexible Box Layout</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-grid-layout/\">CSS Grid Layout</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-regions/\">CSS Regions</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-exclusions/\">CSS Exclusions and Shapes</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css-device-adapt/\">CSS Device Adaptation</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>From Experimental to Stable</h2>\r\n<p>When Web browsers implement emerging standards they do so by marking the new features with their own vendor prefix: a style property prefixed with <code>&#8209;moz&#8209;</code> indicates an experimental CSS feature in Mozilla's Firefox, <code>&#8209;ms&#8209;</code> means the same for Microsoft’s Internet Explorer, <code>&#8209;o&#8209;</code> for Opera, and <code>&#8209;webkit&#8209;</code> for WebKit-based browsers including Google’s Chrome and Apple’s Safari. The features’ object model equivalents are similarly prefixed.</p>\r\n<p>New platform APIs such as <code style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">window.requestAnimationFrame()</code> are likewise currently invoked as <code style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">window.mozRequestAnimationFrame()</code>, <code style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">window.webkitRequestAnimationFrame()</code>, or <code style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">window.msRequestAnimationFrame()</code>.</p>\r\n<p>Browser vendors generally drop their prefix once the corresponding specification reaches the Candidate Recommendation stage. This naming convention has a number of objectives, among which:  </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><b>Allow the specification to evolve:</b> without prefixes web content written for the earliest implementation(s) could constrain the editor(s) and make useful additions or changes difficult or even impossible, and</li>\r\n<li><b>Segregate experimental implementations:</b> the bugs or choice of draft version of a particular browser have no impact on other browsers. </li>\r\n<li><b>Style sheet documentation:</b> the vendor-specific dependencies of a style sheet are explicitly documented</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Other standards may not rely on vendor prefixes at all. For instance, browser vendors never prefixed the new HTML elements introduced by the HTML5 specification such as &lt;canvas&gt; and &lt;video&gt;. </p>\r\n<h2>The Web’s Best Practices </h2>\r\n<p>In practice, there comes a time when several browsers support the same draft feature in an interoperable manner. As a result, Web developers find themselves writing declarations such as:</p>\r\n<code style=\"display: block; font-family: Consolas, Monospace; font-size: 13px; color: Black; text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\"><div style=\"background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Red;\">-webkit-transform</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">rotate(30deg)</span>;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Red;\">-moz-transform</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">rotate(30deg)</span>;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Red;\">-ms-transform</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">rotate(30deg)</span>;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Red;\">-o-transform</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">rotate(30deg)</span>;</p>\r\n</div></code>\r\n<p>After copy and pasting this pattern a number of times, many developers assume the forthcoming W3C standard will be backward compatible with today’s Web. They proceed to “future-proof” their style sheets by adding an unprefixed version of the property:</p>\r\n<code style=\"display: block; font-family: Consolas, Monospace; font-size: 13px; color: Black; text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\"><div style=\"background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Red;\">-webkit-transform</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">rotate(30deg)</span>;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Red;\">-moz-transform</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">rotate(30deg)</span>;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Red;\">-ms-transform</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">rotate(30deg)</span>;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Red;\">-o-transform</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">rotate(30deg)</span>;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Red;\">transform</span>: <span style=\"color: Blue;\">rotate(30deg)</span>;</p>\r\n</div></code>\r\n<p>From a web developer’s point of view, the above set of declarations is now ready for future browsers that support unprefixed CSS Transforms.</p>\r\n<p>Past standard features have in fact validated this pragmatic assumption. When IE9 added support for the unprefixed <code>border-radius</code> property in its first Platform Preview, our team saw the feature “light up” across many sites due to the future-proofed style sheets already deployed.</p>\r\n<p>A number of features are going through the same evolution now. Not only are many CSS Transitions demo pages already future proofed – see <a href=\"http://www.paulrhayes.com/experiments/parallax/#experiment\">Paul Hayes’ parallax effect</a> or <a href=\"http://leaverou.github.com/animatable/\">Lea Verou’s animatable gallery</a> – but open source projects such as <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/html5slides/\">Google’s html5slides</a>, <a href=\"http://davegamache.com/\">designers’ home pages</a>, <a href=\"http://www.impressivewebs.com/animating-css3-gradients/\">site logos</a> and <a href=\"http://www.impressivewebs.com/subtleties-css3-transitions/\">tutorials</a> routinely include unprefixed <code>transition</code> declarations. </p>\r\n<p>Many transition effects involve CSS Transforms, <a href=\"http://blog.typekit.com/2011/01/25/case-study-getting-hardboiled-with-css3-2d-transforms/\">tutorials</a> for which also frequently declare unprefixed <code>transform</code> properties. </p>\r\n<h2>Finishing the Specs</h2>\r\n<p>Even as Web developers anticipate browser convergence in their new markup, the standardization process is far more conservative. While <code>border-radius</code> worked interoperably enough for thousands of Web sites, members of the CSS Working Group were busy defining the rendering of more complex cases such as the appearance of a rounded corner between two adjacent borders of variable widths and colors. Likewise, the CSS <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transitions/\">Transitions</a>, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-animations/\">Animations</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transforms/\">Transforms</a> editors are working to <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=16806\">specify error conditions</a>, <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=14784\">fix errors</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=14658\">clarify less common scenarios</a>. </p> \r\n<p>While these issues must be resolved to ensure a high level of interoperability and to reach Recommendation status, relatively few of them will affect current and future content. Once a specification is stable and interoperable the web should not be held back by the last corner cases. This was not necessary for new HTML5 elements or to finalize the CSS2.1 spec, neither of which required prefixing. </p>\r\n<p>While solid specifications backed up by complete public test suites are critical, requiring all Web developers to repeat the same declarations multiple times until a Candidate Recommendation is published prioritizes spec completeness over content stability.</p>\r\n<p>Finishing a specification is a time-consuming effort. To take one example, CSS gradients <a href=\"http://www.webkit.org/blog/175/introducing-css-gradients/\">emerged in 2008</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/WD-css3-images-20090723/\">first Working Draft specifying an interoperable</a> solution in 2009 and the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-images/\">Candidate Recommendation was published  in April 2012</a>. In the meantime, the standardized syntax became incompatible with the prefixed syntax deployed on many Web sites. The Release Preview of IE10 is the first public unprefixed implementation of the latest spec. (IE10 also supports the more interoperable prefixed version with the <code>&#8209;ms&#8209;</code> vendor prefix.)</p>\r\n<h2>What It Means For Your Code</h2>\r\n<h3>CSS gradients</h3>\r\n<p>While broadly interoperable, the prefixed gradient syntax supported by all modern browsers reflects a now obsolete draft version of the specification. This earlier syntax is incompatible with the current Candidate Recommendation. For example, if you have declared the following gradient:</p>\r\n<code style=\"display: block; font-family: Consolas, Monospace; font-size: 13px; color: Black; text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\"><div style=\"background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">background: -ms-linear-gradient(left, yellow, red);</p></div></code>\r\n<p>Then producing the unprefixed equivalent is not simply a matter of removing the <code>&#8209;ms&#8209;</code> prefix. Because IE10's unprefixed linear gradient function conforms to the latest specification, it should become:</p>\r\n<code style=\"display: block; font-family: Consolas, Monospace; font-size: 13px; color: Black; text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\"><div style=\"background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">background: linear-gradient(to right, yellow, red);</p></div></code>\r\n<p>A future blog post will cover IE10’s support for CSS gradients in more detail.</p>\r\n<h3>Cascading and the CSS Object Model</h3>\r\n<p>The cascade will resolve prefixed CSS properties as expected; given the following rule (notice the higher rotation angle in the unprefixed declaration):</p>\r\n<code style=\"display: block; font-family: Consolas, Monospace; font-size: 13px; color: Black; text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\"><div style=\"background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">-ms-transform:</span> <span style=\"color: Maroon;\">rotate(30deg);</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">transform:</span> <span style=\"color: Maroon;\">rotate(60deg);</span></p>\r\n</div></code>\r\n<p>Your element will rotate 60 degrees: the two properties are treated as aliases of each other and the last declaration wins. Their corresponding CSSOM properties are also aliases: if you request the computed value of the <code>transform</code> and <code>msTransform</code> style properties they will both reflect the winning 60 degree transform. </p>\r\n<p>Likewise, setting <code>element.style.transform</code> will also set <code>element.style.msTransform</code> and vice-versa. </p>\r\n<h3>Serialization of property names</h3>\r\n<p>Properties such as <code>transition-property </code>take a list of CSS property names. For instance, to make the <code>transform</code> property transition over 2 seconds in IE10 Consumer Preview a developer would write:</p>\r\n<code style=\"display: block; font-family: Consolas, Monospace; font-size: 13px; color: Black; text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\"><div style=\"background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">-<span style=\"color: Maroon;\">ms-transition-property:</span> -<span style=\"color: Maroon;\">ms-transform;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">-<span style=\"color: Maroon;\">ms-transition-duration:</span> 2<span style=\"color: Maroon;\">s;</span></p>\r\n</div></code>\r\n<p>IE10 Release Preview will serialize the value of both <code>style.msTransitionProperty</code> and <code>style.transitionProperty</code> as ‘<code>transform</code>’. Note that the original prefix is not preserved. </p>\r\n<p>This is also true for the <code>propertyName</code> property of transition events.</p>\r\n<h3>Animation and Transition event type names</h3>\r\n<p>IE10 Release Preview allows the registration of Animation and Transition event listeners using both prefixed and unprefixed names i.e. the following are equivalent: </p>\r\n<code style=\"display: block; font-family: Consolas, Monospace; font-size: 13px; color: Black; text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\"><div style=\"background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">element.addEventListener(<span style=\"color: Maroon;\">&quot;MSTransitionEnd&quot;</span>, myHandler, <span style=\"color: Blue;\">false</span>);</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\">element.addEventListener(<span style=\"color: Maroon;\">&quot;transitionend&quot;</span>, myHandler, <span style=\"color: Blue;\">false</span>);</p>\r\n</div></code>\r\n<p>But IE10 Release Preview will always return an unprefixed name in the <code>type</code> property of the event object.</p>\r\n<h2>What’s Next</h2>\r\n<p>We will submit new test cases to the W3C for all the features that IE10 now supports without a prefix. As Working Group members and co-editors, we will work with our colleagues to move these specifications forward to Candidate Recommendation.</p>\r\n<p>We welcome feedback you have on our support for these feature and their cross-browser compatibility.</p>\r\n<p>—Sylvain Galineau, Program Manager, Internet Explorer</p>\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div><img src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=10316058\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">"

94ff9d47-51d9-a129-f484-2033ea0fa4c2.description	"<p>With IE10 in Windows 8, we reimagined the browser. We designed and built IE10 to be the best way to experience the full Web on Windows. Consumers can now enjoy more touch-friendly, fast and fluid Web applications with the updated IE10 engine included in the <a href=\"http://preview.windows.com/\">Windows Release Preview</a>. This sixth Platform Preview of IE10 delivers improved performance and support for touch-first HTML5, as well as a new power-optimized, touch-friendly Adobe Flash Player that enables content on compatible Web sites to play in the Metro style Web browser. IE10 also sends the &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; signal to Web sites by default to help consumers protect their privacy.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\"><iframe width='720' height='404' frameborder='0' src='http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/ieblog/common/videoframe.htm?mp4=http://media.ch9.ms/ch9/1931/1b7645a7-bd9c-4e6f-bf0e-4862953c1931/IE10TestDriveReleasePreview_mid.mp4'></iframe><br /> This video shows some of the performance and touch improvements in the sixth IE10 Platform Preview, part of the Windows Release Preview.<br /> <a href=\"http://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/IE/Internet-Explorer-10-Test-Drive-on-Windows-8-Release-Preview\" target=\"_blank\">(This video is also available on Channel 9)</a></p>\r\n<p>You can read more about the improvements to the Metro style browsing experience on the <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8\">Building Windows 8</a> blog. The remainder of this post discusses the underlying HTML5 engine.</p>\r\n<p>Windows 8 includes one HTML5 browsing engine that powers both browsing experiences (the Metro style one and desktop one) as well as Metro style applications that use HTML5 and JavaScript. The common HTML5 engine provides consistently fast, safe, and powerful support for Web standards and the Web programming model, for both browser experiences as well as for Metro style applications.</p>\r\n<p>Consumers experience this power with responsive, touch-friendly pages that safely take full advantage of the underlying hardware. Some examples that you can try at the <a href=\"http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/\">IE Test Drive site</a> with the Consumer Preview include the Chalkboard Benchmark for common touch actions like panning and zooming and a multi-touch capable Web page for manipulating photos and images. You can read the full list in the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/gg192966\"> IE10 developer guide</a>.</p>\r\n<h3>Touch-friendly Adobe Flash in Metro style Internet Explorer 10</h3>\r\n<p>The Windows 8 Release Preview includes a new power-optimized, touch-friendly Adobe Flash Player. Adobe Flash content on compatible Web sites will now play in Metro style IE10. Metro style IE10 with Flash on Windows 8 enables people to see more of the Web working with high quality, especially compared with the experience in other touch-first or tablet experiences.</p>\r\n<p>We believe that having more sites &ldquo;just work&rdquo; in the Metro style browser improves the experience for consumers and businesses alike. As a practical matter, the primary device you walk around with should play the Web content on sites you rely on. Otherwise, the device is just a companion to a PC. Because some popular Web sites require Adobe Flash and do not offer HTML5 alternatives, Adobe and Microsoft worked together closely to deliver a Flash Player suitable for the Metro style experience.</p>\r\n<p>Both IE10 on the Windows desktop and Metro style IE use the same integrated Flash Player, with no need to download or install an additional player. IE10 on the desktop provides the same full Flash support as previous versions of IE that relied on the Flash Player plug-in, and continues to support other plug-ins. The Metro style browser continues to provide no support for other separate ActiveX controls or plug-ins.</p>\r\n<p>While any site can play Flash content in IE10 on the Windows desktop, only sites that are on the Compatibility View (<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/gg622935(v=vs.85).aspx\">CV</a>) list can play Flash content within Metro style IE. We place sites with Flash content on the CV list if doing so delivers the best user experience in Metro style IE with those sites. For example, how responsive is the content to touch? Does it work well with the onscreen keyboard, or affect battery life? Do visual prompts comply with the Metro style user experience guidelines? Sites that rely on capabilities (e.g. rollovers and P2P functionality) that are not supported within the Metro style experience, and don&rsquo;t degrade gracefully in their absence, are better off running in IE with Flash on the desktop. Site developers continue to control the content they serve to browsers. Developers can send HTML5 content to Metro style IE, or express their preference that Metro style IE prompt users to run their site on the desktop (see details <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2012/01/31/web-sites-and-a-plug-in-free-web.aspx\">here</a>).</p>\r\n<p>A good Flash Player experience is part of a no compromise experience across all form factors of PCs, including touch-centric PCs running Windows 8. We&rsquo;ve heard feedback from customers about their experience with sites that do not offer an HTML5 experience. For example, try pbskids.org on an iPad. Some workforce solutions, like <a href=\"https://www.beeline.com/\">Beeline</a>, require Flash. Some financial management sites, like <a href=\"https://www.benefitaccess.com/\">this one</a>, require Flash. And some sites still deliver their best experience with Flash, such as youtube.com.</p>\r\n<p>Adobe and Microsoft added support for touch gestures &ndash; like double tap and pinch to zoom &ndash; that work consistently across HTML5 and Flash. Adobe and Microsoft worked together to disable the desktop Flash functionality that is incompatible with touch, such as rollovers, within the Metro style experience. Much of Flash&rsquo;s other functionality works well with touch.</p>\r\n<p>Together we have also improved battery life with better support for <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2012/04/17/reclaiming-memory-from-metro-style-apps.aspx\"> PLM</a> in the Metro style experience. Flash on Windows has already supported offloading potentially battery-draining video work to specialized video hardware for some time (<a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/flashplayer/2011/03/adobe-supports-microsoft-ie-9.html\">link</a>). This work improves responsiveness and performance as well.</p>\r\n<p>Adobe and Microsoft have worked closely together for some time to address security and reliability issues (for example <a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/asset/2010/07/working-together.html\"> here</a>, and <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/sdl/archive/2009/06/17/microsoft-adobe-protecting-our-customers-together.aspx\">here</a>), sharing best practices like the <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/security/sdl\">SDL</a>/<a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/security/splc/\">SPLC</a> and ASLR as well as information on hangs and crashes. By updating Flash through Windows Update, like IE, we make security more convenient for customers. Microsoft and Adobe remain committed to meeting the expectations of Windows customers with regard to the delivery of security updates. We are also working together on accessibility, manageability, and privacy.</p>\r\n<p>The Flash Player included with Windows 8 is based on the full PC implementation and not a limited mobile subset, and there&rsquo;s a clear path to make it available on the new chip architectures that Windows 8 supports. Adobe is committed to delivering this same Flash Player support for Metro style IE on both x86/64 and the initial delivery of Windows RT PCs (Windows running on ARM processors).</p>\r\n<p>For the development community, platform continuity and technology choice are important. Flash in Metro style IE10 provides a bridge for existing sites to transition to HTML5 technologies where it makes sense and at a pace that is right for the experiences they want to deliver to their customers. HTML5 does not currently support, for example, some premium video content and game scenarios.</p>\r\n<p>We will provide additional technical information in the coming weeks through the regular documentation channels, like MSDN and <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/devnet.html\"> Adobe Developer Connection</a>. These details will include how developers can test Flash content on their own sites in Metro style IE, and how to submit their sites for consideration for the CV list. This documentation will also include a best practices guide to help developers, designers, and content publishers create experiences with Flash that plays well on Metro style IE. These best practices will complement existing recommendations on authoring touch-friendly HTML5 sites.</p>\r\n<h3>&ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; on By Default in IE in Windows 8</h3>\r\n<p>In Windows 8, IE10 sends a &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; signal to Web sites by default. Consumers can change this default setting if they choose. This decision reflects our commitment to providing Windows customers an experience that is &ldquo;private by default&rdquo; in an era when so much user data is collected online. IE10 is the first browser to send a &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; (DNT) signal by default.</p>\r\n<p>By changing the default Do Not Track setting in IE 10, we are broadening our commitment to providing consumers a great experience in Windows. And in the event companies don&rsquo;t respect the Do Not Track signal, IE 10 will continue to include Tracking Protection list support to help consumers block unwanted tracking with two clicks. While some people will say that this change is too much and others that it is not enough, we think it is progress and that consumers will favor products designed with their privacy in mind over products that are designed primarily to gather their data.</p>\r\n<p>You can read more about other actions underway with DNT <a href=\"http://blogs.technet.com/b/microsoft_on_the_issues/archive/2012/05/31/advancing-consumer-trust-and-privacy-internet-explorer-in-windows-8.aspx\"> here</a>.</p>\r\n<h3>Vendor prefixes, and moving the Web forward from experimental to stable</h3>\r\n<p>With the Release Preview of Windows 8, IE10 adds support for non-vendor prefixed versions of standards that have reached Candidate Recommendation (CR) status since the Windows 8 Consumer Preview or should reach CR in 2012.</p>\r\n<p>With this change, IE10 makes it easier for Web developers to write markup that works consistently across different browsers. Specifically, IE10 now supports the following W3C draft standards in their unprefixed form starting with the Release Preview: CSS transitions, transforms, animations, gradients, and CSS Fonts&rsquo; <code>font-feature-settings</code> property, as well as platform APIs such as the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/\">Indexed Database API</a> (<code>IndexedDB</code>) and <code>requestAnimationFrame()</code>.</p>\r\n<p>We selected these standards after examining <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh673549(v=vs.85).aspx\">all the W3C draft standards</a> IE10 supports and looking for standards that are stable (having no significant renaming or removal of properties/values expected), supported and interoperable across at least two browsers other than IE10 for the features&rsquo; core use cases, and already in use on the Web, including in their unprefixed form.</p>\r\n<p>Browser vendors generally drop the vendor prefix once a specification reaches CR. For compatibility with sites and apps developed using the Windows 8 Consumer Preview and that rely on the Microsoft vendor prefix, IE10 continues to support the <code style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">-ms-</code> vendor-prefixed forms as well. Note that IE10 continues to support only the vendor-prefixed form of several other standards because these specifications are not yet sufficiently stable and interoperable, for example <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-flexbox/\"> CSS Flexible Box Layout</a>.</p>\r\n<p>As a best practice, developers typically add an unprefixed version of a property to &ldquo;future-proof&rdquo; their pages. The following set of declarations is now ready for future browsers that support unprefixed CSS Transforms:</p>\r\n<div style=\"text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: black; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: red;\">-webkit-transform</span>: <span style=\"color: blue;\">rotate(30deg)</span>;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: red;\">-moz-transform</span>: <span style=\"color: blue;\">rotate(30deg)</span>;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: red;\">-ms-transform</span>: <span style=\"color: blue;\">rotate(30deg)</span>;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: red;\">-o-transform</span>: <span style=\"color: blue;\">rotate(30deg)</span>;</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><code><span style=\"color: red;\">transform</span>: <span style=\"color: blue;\">rotate(30deg)</span>;</code></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h3>Other Key Platform Changes</h3>\r\n<p>In the Release Preview, we continue to improve performance. Web pages should just &ldquo;stick to your finger&rdquo; and remain fast and fluid while panning, zooming, and scaling content. The Chalkboard Benchmark shows the results of some of our performance work. It measures how efficiently a browser can perform these common touch actions by zooming in and out of a &ldquo;chalkboard&rdquo; while panning left, right, up, and then down. IE10&rsquo;s performance here is a great example of Internet Explorer&rsquo;s hardware acceleration in action.</p>\r\n<p>Performance improvements contribute to great touch support, for example with full independent composition of Web page contents (fixed elements, subscrollers, animations, and video). We&rsquo;ve also improved performance on low-end hardware; intensive sites now show much less flashing and flickering on low-end hardware. These improvements make IE10&rsquo;s support for full screen video playback (in both HTML5 video and Adobe Flash Player) even better.</p>\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve continued to improve the performance of the Chakra JavaScript engine. JavaScript intensive Web applications, like HTML5 games, will benefit from dynamic profile-based JIT, type-specialized code generation for floating point numbers, expansion of function inlining, and further tuning to reduce the idle memory footprint while reducing the observable pauses due to garbage collection.</p>\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve also improved standards support in a number of ways. IE10 now has support for IVS/Emoji characters and the <code>classList</code> API and new <code>reverse</code> and <code>alternate-reverse</code> values of the <code>animation-direction</code> CSS property. DOM exceptions match the W3C WebIDL spec, and developers can use a constructor to create <code>Blob</code> objects, matching the W3C spec. We&rsquo;ve also removed legacy DX filters from all modes.</p>\r\n<p>HTML5 applications and sites can do more with touch via the <code>MSGesture</code> APIs that provide instantiable gesture event handling.</p>\r\n<h3>A Better Web Today, and Ahead</h3>\r\n<p>The opportunities continue for HTML5 to make both Web sites and applications better. Those opportunities are exciting for everyone on the Web.</p>\r\n<p>To get to that Web sooner, we continue to recommend that developers update old and out of date patterns on their sites. Looking at the CV list you can find examples of sites that need <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shim_(computing)\">shimming</a> because they use out of date libraries (e.g. <a href=\"http://Thetimes.co.uk\"> here</a>) or rely on browser detection rather than feature detection. The compatibility problem reports we receive have more to do with sites detecting IE and sending it different content than they send other browsers than any particular issue in IE. Developers can find sample feature detection code patterns in several IE blog posts, including <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/09/13/ie10pp3.aspx\">this one</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The quality and correctness of different browsers&rsquo; HTML5 engines continue to vary widely. We will submit updates to test cases to the W3C for all the features that IE10 now supports without a prefix. As members and co-editors of the CSS Working Group, we will work with our colleagues to move these specifications forward to Candidate Recommendation. We continue to contribute to the <a href=\"http://w3c-test.org/html/tests/reporting/report.htm\">test suites</a> under development at the HTML5 standards bodies to further the goal of interoperability and same markup. We&rsquo;ve submitted and updated over <a href=\"http://samples.msdn.microsoft.com/ietestcenter/\"> 240 tests</a> to them that you can view at the IE Test Center as well. As different browsers improve their support of the same markup to produce the same results, we can all realize the promise of HTML5.</p>\r\n<p>You can find a full list of new functionality available to developers in the IE10 developer guide <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/gg192966\">here</a>. Download the <a href=\"http://windows.microsoft.com/release-preview\">Windows 8 Release Preview</a> to try this update to IE10. We look forward to continued engagement with the developer community and your feedback on <a href=\"http://connect.microsoft.com/ie\">Connect</a>.</p>\r\n<p>&mdash;Dean Hachamovitch, Corporate Vice President, Internet Explorer</p><div style=\"clear:both;\"></div><img src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=10312869\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">"

f11b7009-4332-6ee4-ef70-cf252546db4e.description	"<p>Sharing a link to a Web page is a common activity on the PC, and it gets better with IE10 on Windows 8. One of the new features on Windows 8 is the Share charm, which allows you to seamlessly send content between apps on your PC. Previously, if you wanted to share an interesting article with your friend, or post a funny picture on your blog, you’d copy the link from the address bar, switch to a different site or app, and then paste it. Now, with the Windows 8 Share charm, you can share directly from the browser without ever leaving your current page.</p>\r\n<p>When you use the Share charm to share a site from the browser, IE10 creates two data formats that contain relevant content – the URI, and some HTML that includes a rich representation of the page. Here are two examples of data that get shared for a YouTube video:</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 0.25in;\">The URI (of the current site)</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><code>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DbgiOCTQts</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 0.25in;\">The HTML (with a link preview)</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\"><img style=\"max-width: 85%; padding: 12px; border: 1px solid #999; box-shadow: 3px 3px 8px 0px hsla(0, 0%, 0%, 0.25);\" alt=\"An example of IE10&#39;s rich preview of Web pages\" src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/2313.gysrfswi_2D00_gysrfswi_2D00_image1_2D00_1_5F00_521x115.png\" /><br />An example of IE10's rich preview of Web pages</p>\r\n<p>Both of these data formats are created for an “implicit” share, which is the name for what happens when you share the site that you are currently viewing. Since Web pages can be represented as hyperlinks or a rich HTML link preview, IE10 includes both types of data. Of course, if you aren’t sharing the whole page, but rather, some content that you’ve highlighted, IE10 will share the HTML of your selection instead of the URI and the link preview. In this case, sharing a selection would be called an “explicit” share, and does not include the link. This post describes the link sharing case, how IE10 participates in the Windows 8 Share contract using HTML, and how Web developers can create link previews with just a few meta-tags.</p>\r\n<h2>The Share Charm and IE10</h2>\r\n<p>Here’s a video of how a user might share links from the browser to an app that uses HTML.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\">\r\n    <iframe width='640' height='360' frameborder='0' src='http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/ieblog/common/videoframe.htm?mp4=http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-video/0511.SharingLinkPreviews_2800_Yelp_2900_.mp4'></iframe><br />\r\n               Sharing from IE10: Link Previews in Action</p>\r\n<p>In this video, “Stash” is a sample link saving app that makes use of the Windows share charm with HTML. The sample app simply supports the HTML data format for sharing, and IE provides the link preview. Link previews are HTML that contains a title, image, and description for every shared link. This makes it easy for you to recognize the site content. If you have <a href=\"http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/download\">Windows 8 Consumer Preview</a> and <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/11/en-us/downloads\">Visual Studio 11 Beta</a>, you can <a href=\"http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Browser/Windows8Share/DownloadDemoApp.html\" target=\"_blank\">download and run Stash</a> on your own PC. Stash integrates with the Windows 8 Share contract as a target app, as you can see below. Below, you can see a high-level diagram that shows how links are shared from IE10.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\"><img style=\"max-width: 95%; padding: 8px; border: 1px solid #999; box-shadow: 3px 3px 8px 0px hsla(0, 0%, 0%, 0.25);\" alt=\"Diagram showing sharing a link from IE10 to target apps, using the Share charm’s data package\" src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/7028.gysrfswi_2D00_image1_5F00_760x385.png\" /><br />Diagram: Sharing a link from IE10 to target apps, using the Share charm’s data package</p>\r\n<p>Windows 8 Share charm handles the coordination between the source and target apps to provide an integrated sharing experience across all apps. This removes the need for target and source apps to be aware and coordinate between each other. </p>\r\n<h2>Sharing the Web is Better, Start to Finish</h2>\r\n<p>The Web is made up of HTML. That’s why HTML is one of the most important data formats in IE10’s integration with the Share contract. IE10 creates link previews to both provide a better sharing experience for users, and to help connect Web developers to Windows 8 Share. With a little extra meta-data markup, sites can define what information is included in their link previews. On the other end of the share contract, target apps that support the HTML data format can get the full experience of contextual Web hyperlinks without having to parse a single site. The end result is a rich, modern, and fluid sharing experience, from end to end.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\"><img style=\"max-width: 95%; border: 1px solid #999; box-shadow: 3px 3px 8px 0px hsla(0, 0%, 0%, 0.25);\" alt=\"Screenshot of target apps available in Share pane\" src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/6840.gysrfswi_2D00_image2_5F00_760x475.png\" /><br />Screenshot of target apps available in Share pane</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\"><img style=\"max-width: 95%; border: 1px solid #999; box-shadow: 3px 3px 8px 0px hsla(0, 0%, 0%, 0.25);\" alt=\"Screenshot of Stash’s Share Pane\" src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/4885.gysrfswi_2D00_image3_5F00_760x475.png\" /><br />Screenshot of Stash’s Share Pane</p>\r\n<p>When you share a Web site, IE10 parses that site to create a link preview. In the example above, it’s a short snippet of content that represents a movie page on IMDb. The goal of sharing HTML, in addition to the URI, is to share the best possible representation of what the user intended to share, so IE10 creates link previews for all implicit shares. The benefits of HTML are that it can include more information than a URI, and the content of the HTML is more meaningful than a hyperlink. In the words of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Knope\">Leslie Knope</a>, no one wants to share that “complicated nonsense.”</p>\r\n<div style=\"position: relative; height: auto;\">\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 8.25pt; font-style: italic;\"><img style=\"max-width: 95%; border: 1px solid #999; box-shadow: 3px 3px 8px 0px hsla(0, 0%, 0%, 0.25);\" alt=\"Frame grab from the NBC show Parks and Recreation. Character Ron Swanson is holding a Knope for City Council sign most of which is long, complicated URL. Character Leslie Knope is saying, &quot;So, as you can imagine, we would have never ordered a sign with all this complicated nonsense because, you know, we’re not insane.&quot;\" src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-38-71-metablogapi/8508.parks_5F00_and_5F00_recreation.jpg\" /><br />\r\nFrom NBC’s <a href=\"http://www.nbc.com/parks-and-recreation/\">Parks and Recreation</a>, Season 4, Episode 16</p>\r\n<div style=\"position: absolute; bottom: 2em; width: 100%; text-align: center;\"><span style=\"display: block; margin: 0 auto; -moz-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 600px; padding: 0 3em; font-style: normal; color: White; font-size: 16px;\">So, as you can imagine, we would have never ordered a sign with all this complicated nonsense because, you know, we’re not insane.</span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Depending on the target app, though, sometimes rich content is not the best kind of data, and a URI is more useful. For example, blogging apps can take advantage of rich HTML content, and SMS apps would do best to use the URI. Developers of Metro style apps choose the data format(s) that make most sense for their app to receive, following the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh771179.aspx\">Windows 8 Share guidance</a>. </p>\r\n<h2>Sites Use Markup to Define What IE10 Shares</h2>\r\n<p>Since IE10 uses existing markup meant for sharing on the Web, many sites will already look great when sharing HTML link previews on Windows 8. We support the <a href=\"http://ogp.me/\">Open Graph protocol</a> as a simple way to add meta-data about the page. When users share sites on Facebook and through Windows 8 and IE10, you can use OpenGraph to control the way your Web page appears to others. </p>\r\n<p>Here’s an example of <a href=\"http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Performance/BrickBreaker/\" target=\"_blank\">an IE test drive demo</a> that uses this markup:</p>\r\n<code style=\"display: block; font-family: Consolas, Monospace; font-size: 13px; color: Black; text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\"><div style=\"background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">head</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">meta</span> <span style=\"color: Red;\">name</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">=&quot;description&quot;</span> <span style=\"color: Red;\">content</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">=&quot;Brick Breaker TestDrive Demo Game, Performance and Touch benchmark&quot;</span> <span style=\"color: Blue;\">/&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">title</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&gt;</span>Brick Breaker<span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;/</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">title</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">meta</span> <span style=\"color: Red;\">property</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">=&quot;og:image&quot;</span> <span style=\"color: Red;\">content</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">=&quot;Views/Homepage/Icons/BrickBreaker.png&quot;</span> <span style=\"color: Blue;\">/&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;/</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">head</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&gt;</span></p>\r\n</div></code>\r\n<p>IE looks for the following tags in the site’s markup to create the page’s link preview.</p>\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\r\n<tr><th>Property</th>\r\n<th>HTML tag</th>\r\n<th>Character limit</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr><td>Title 1</td>\r\n<td>&lt;meta name=\"title\" content=\"Insert Site Title Here” /&gt;</td>\r\n<td>160</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr><td>Title 2</td>\r\n<td>&lt;title&gt;Insert Site Title Here&lt;/title&gt;</td>\r\n<td>160</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr><td>Description</td>\r\n<td>&lt;meta name=\"description\" content=\"Insert Site Description Here” /&gt;</td>\r\n<td>253</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr><td>Image 1</td>\r\n<td>&lt;meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"insert_image_link_here\" /&gt;</td>\r\n<td>2,048 (limit for image URI)</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr><td>Image 2</td>\r\n<td>&lt;link rel=\"image_src\" href=\"insert_image_link_here\" /&gt;</td>\r\n<td>2,048 (limit for image URI)</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr><td>Image 3</td>\r\n<td>&lt;meta name=\"image\" content=\"insert_image_link_here\" /&gt;</td>\r\n<td>2,048 (limit for image URI)</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr><td>Image 4</td>\r\n<td>&lt;meta name=\"thumbnail\" content=\"insert_image_link_here\" /&gt;</td>\r\n<td>2,048 (limit for image URI)</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>Note that this is the order in which we parse for each attribute. For example, if both Image 1 and Image 2 tags are present, we’ll use the Image 1 tag. Additionally, if more than one tag of any type is present, we use the first one you list in your markup.</p>\r\n<p>For character limits, if the description is longer than the maximum length, IE will put a “…” at the end in the preview.</p>\r\n<p>Make sure to include at least one of each property in your site markup to get your pages looking great for sharing in Windows 8. See <a href=\"http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Browser/Windows8Share/\" target=\"_blank\">this demo on the IE Test Drive site</a> for more on how the markup works.</p>\r\n<h2>Apps Get the Benefit of a Powerful Web Browser</h2>\r\n<p>If your app supports the Share target app contract, you should consider whether it makes sense for it to support HTML as a shared data format. Apps that use HTML can benefit from the link previews shared by IE10 because IE10 does all of the heavy lifting. It parses the site and puts together a short and informative link preview, and all your app needs to do is display and host the HTML. The hyperlink is embedded within the preview, so it functions just like a Uri, but looks much better. This way, apps that don’t have the resources to parse the Web to condense pages into small, rich previews, can still display contextual links as HTML.  </p>\r\n<p>Many apps, in addition to IE10, will share HTML. Target apps that accept HTML must be agnostic about the source of the shared data. As noted above, IE10 shares HTML for both implicit and explicit sharing scenarios, so sometimes the HTML is a link preview, and sometimes it’s a user selection. In either case, the content of the HTML is the best possible representation of what the user intended to share. Here’s a snippet of what the link preview HTML generated by IE10 will look like when it’s added to the Share charm’s Data Package:</p>\r\n<code style=\"display: block; font-family: Consolas, Monospace; font-size: 13px; color: Black; text-indent: -4em; padding: 0 0.25in;\"><div style=\"background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 0 4px 2px 4px;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">html</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">body</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">style</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">/* IE10</span>\\uc1\\u8217?s metro-style CSS attributes */</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;/</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">style</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">a</span> <span style=\"color: Red;\">class</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">=&quot;snippet-URL&quot;</span> <span style=\"color: Red;\">href</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">=&quot;http://site_link_goes_here&quot;&gt;</span>Website Title goes here<span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;/</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">a</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">table</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">tr</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 10em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">td</span> <span style=\"color: Red;\">class</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">=&quot;snippet-image&quot;&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 12em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">img</span> <span style=\"color: Red;\">src</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">=&quot;image_link_goes_here&quot;</span> <span style=\"color: Blue;\">/&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 10em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;/</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">td</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 10em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">td</span> <span style=\"color: Red;\">class</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">=&quot;snippet-text&quot;&gt;</span>Website description goes here <span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;/</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">td</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 8em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;/</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">tr</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;/</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">table</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 6em;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0,100,0);\">&lt;!--EndFragment--&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;/</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">body</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 4em;\"><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&lt;/</span><span style=\"color: Maroon;\">html</span><span style=\"color: Blue;\">&gt;</span></p>\r\n</div></code>\r\n<p>For an example of an app that uses HTML from IE10, <a href=\"http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Browser/Windows8Share/DownloadDemoApp.html\" target=\"_blank\">download the sample app “Stash”</a> seen in the video above.

e3946b03-3ce7-0cd5-dd00-dce500f43a61.description	"<p>Today is Alan Turing&#8217;s 100th birthday. I&#8217;ve been thinking about him lately, in particular about a story that demonstrates the perils of working with genius.</p>\n<p>The story goes that, when Turing was working with the Manchester Baby (the first stored program computer ever built. Just) a colleague wrote the first ever assembler which would turn (relatively) human readable assembly language and turn it into the ones and zeroes of machine code that the machine could actually execute. He showed it to Turing, who blew up at him, ranting that using the computer to do &#8216;trivial&#8217; jobs like that were a massive waste of expensive computer time.</p>\n<p>The problem with working with a genius, from the point of view of more ordinary mortals, is that the genius has only a very rough idea of what is actually easy, and what is only easy to them. From today&#8217;s vantage point, when computers are as freely available as they are now, the idea of <em>not</em> letting the computer do the shitwork for you seems utterly ludicrous &#8211; programmer time is more valuable than computer time.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s less obvious is that the same was true in Turing&#8217;s time (when there was precisely one computer) too. It only takes one programmer to make a mistake in translating from assembler to machine code and run a job that, for instance, gets stuck in an infinite loop and you&#8217;ve probably wasted more computer time (and programmer time) than if you&#8217;d just run it through the assembler in the first place. Turing didn&#8217;t see that, because the process of translating from symbols to binary wasn&#8217;t something that he found particularly complicated. To him, what was needed wasn&#8217;t more and better tools, it was more and better Turings.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not entirely sure that I believe the story (and I can&#8217;t remember where I heard it, so it may be a phantom of my memory). It certainly doesn&#8217;t chime with the Turing who was instrumental in mechanising the shitwork of finding the days rotor settings so that Enigma traffic could be cracked. The history of Bletchley Park is a story of building better and better machines to do the dully repetitive jobs that humans find so hard to stick to and which machines excel at.</p>\n<p>The &#8220;Just write code without bugs in the first place&#8221; school of programming is alive and well today. It&#8217;s not my school though. I&#8217;m very much an exploratory coder. I like to have tests to show me the way and to keep me honest so that I don&#8217;t go breaking things when I change this bit here. I&#8217;ve customised my editing environment to help me as much as possible. I have a nasty habit of writing bare words that I should have quoted, so I have a keystroke that shoves the last word into quotes for me. Another keystroke will align all the broad arrows at the current level of nesting. I&#8217;ve got snippets set up that fill in standard boilerplate when I start a new class, a huge list of common spelling mistakes that get autocorrected while I&#8217;m not looking and an expanding list of other little helpers that I need to write when I get around to it. Automation lets me go faster, make more and better mistakes and recover from them faster. I am a of little brain and I want all the help I can give myself.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure that Turing would be in the same camp as me.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the thing though &#8211; Turing was, definitely, a genius. But his paper &#8220;On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem&#8221; (the one that gave the world the Turing Machine) has a bug in it. In fact, it has two. The first is obvious enough that I spotted it when i read the paper for the first time. The second bug is rather more subtle (but still fixable. It&#8217;s okay, the field of computing is not build on sand).</p>\n<p>I love that The Paper &#8211; The one that&#8217;s the theoretical basis for the modern world (first publishd 75 years ago, round(ish) number fans) &#8211; has a bug. It gives me a strange kind of hope. Fallibility gets us all &#8211; even people who have saved the world. I think we should celebrate the humanity as well as the genius. Turing was, by all accounts, a very odd fish, but the world is undeniably richer for his contributions.</p>\n<p>So, let&#8217;s raise a glass to the memory of Alan Turing tonight, marathon runner, gay icon, saviour of the world and the pleasantly fallible inventor of the modern world. Not a bad CV, when you think about it.</p>\n<h4>Updated</h4>\n<p>Apparently I&#8217;m wrong about it being Turing who didn&#8217;t like the assembler but Von Neumann (another genius). See below for details. And phew! How nice to find that a hero doesn&#8217;t have feet of clay.</p>"

It just so happened that <span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span> (Yet Another Perl Conference) was held in Asheville this year, the week before the gathering&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.swangathering.com/Catalog/TS/sgtssched.html\">Traditional Song Week</a>. Well, I&#8217;m a perl hacker. I sing traditional songs. My employer was paying for me to attend <span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span> and were willing for me to extend my stay in America by a week. It was a no brainer really.</p>\n<p><span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span> was bloody good this year. Perl 5 development is moving forward and the community is buzzing because of it. Lots of &#8220;… and we&#8217;re hiring&#8221; slides. And that&#8217;s before we get to the pleasure of catching up with friends that I only see online most of the time. If you&#8217;re working in any field that has grassroots conferences associated with it, I can&#8217;t recommend attending them highly enough.</p>\n<h3>On to Swannanoa</h3>\n<p>At Swannanoa, I met Sheila Kay Adams and immediately switched my schedule to spend as much time singing with her as possible. Sheila&#8217;s a seventh generation ballad singer from the Sodom Laurel community in Madison Count. Her &#8220;grannie Berzil&#8221; Wallin remembered Cecil Sharp coming to Madison County and collecting songs from the family.</p>\n<p>Pedigree in singing shouldn&#8217;t matter, but it turns out it does. Sheila grew up in a community which was changing, but which still had old &#8216;love songs&#8217; as an important part of how it understood the world. Today, not so much. People still relate to the world and understand it through songs, but the songs are more likely to be contemporary. Lyrically, many of the love songs that Sheila and her family sing could have been written yesterday, but their performance is radically different from contemporary style. One voice, unaccompanied, a style that requires the listener to concentrate on the song rather than any aspects of production. Not something you&#8217;re going to dance to at your wedding, say.</p>\n<p>Sheila&#8217;s classes, on Meeting House Songs (more later) and her Ballads class with Bobbie McMillon were just wonderful; I won&#8217;t forget in a hurry the sound Bobbie singing &#8220;A conversation with Death&#8221; as a thunderstorm grumbled across the campus in the background. Spine tingling stuff. Sheila&#8217;s description of how she learned songs &#8220;knee to knee&#8221; has been helpful too. The way it would work was that the teacher and student would be sat out on the porch, often doing some chore or another, and the teacher would sing the first verse of a song. The student would sing it back and the teacher would sing the second verse. The student would then sing the first two verses then the teacher would sing the third verse and the student would sing the first three verses and so on, until the student was singing the whole song back to the teacher. A time consuming process to be sure, but it works.</p>\n<p>I know this because I learned Pretty Saro from a recording of Sheila&#8217;s late husband Jim Taylor, using a variant of the method, &#8220;knee to CD&#8221; if you like. I&#8217;d play the first verse, hit pause and sing it back, play the second verse, pause, repeat the first two… and so on. And in very short order I had the words and tune (up to a point; I listened back to that recording again recently and I&#8217;m singing a different tune now) and could start the process of actually <em>learning</em> the song, which involved singing it it lots, listening to other recordings, singing it some more and then taking the song out and trying it out in front of audiences and listening to what works and what doesn&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve never really finished learning a song; this recording is a snapshot. I hope you enjoy it.</p>"

13a566d2-d55c-94d9-68bc-51acf4a0a31c.description	"<p>I sometimes think that I should have published the lyrics to <a href=\"http://www.bofh.org.uk/child-of-the-library\">Child of the Library</a> with a bibliography. The references in the second verse are all obvious to me, but I&#8217;m a white middle class English boy who grew up around boats. My childhood reading and yours may not intersect all that much.</p>\n<p>So&#8230;</p>\n<h4>The Walkers and the Blacketts</h4>\n<p>Also known as the <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=intitle:%22Swallows+and+Amazons%22\">Swallows and Amazons.</a> <cite>Swallows and Amazons</cite> is the first &#8216;big&#8217; book that I can remember reading for myself. We were in Cornwall, holidaying at the same place my mum&#8217;s been going to since she was a kid. Mum was reading <cite>Swallows and Amazons</cite> to us, and it was great, but I was impatient to find out what happened next, so I took the book to bed with me and read it for myself. I haven&#8217;t stopped yet. <cite>Swallows and Amazons</cite> was the book that opened my door to reading for pleasure. It opened up a way of looking at the world too. I can&#8217;t imagine who I&#8217;d be if I&#8217;d never read any Ransome.</p>\n<h4>The Pevensies</h4>\n<p>The Pevensies are the family in <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=intitle:%22The+Lion+The+Witch+And+The+Wardrobe%22\">The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe,</a> the first of the Narnia books. I have a slightly troubled relationship with these books now. I <em>really</em> don&#8217;t get on with C. S. Lewis&#8217;s view of the world (I once hurled a taped reading of <cite>The Screwtape Letters</cite> out of the car rather than listen to another word of the bloody things), but I wasn&#8217;t reading between the lines when I was nine. I was just loving the stories and the images they put in my head. And what images&#8230;</p>\n<h4>Simp, the Canine Cannonball</h4>\n<p>What do you mean, you&#8217;ve never read <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=intitle:%22Cannonball+Simp%22\">Cannonball Simp?</a> You poor thing!</p>\n<p><cite>Cannonball Simp</cite>, by John Burningham is <em>the</em> library book for me. Back when I was 4 or 5, I would walk with my dad from Regent&#8217;s Square to the Doncaster Central Library every Saturday morning, with three books clutched under my arm. I&#8217;d hand them over the counter, receiving in exchange 3 buff cardboard library slip holders. I would then go over to the childrens&#8217; books section and pull out three new (to me) books and take them to the counter. The librarian would remove the slip from the library bookplate, place it in one of my surrendered holders and stamp the slip and the bookplate with the date, three weeks hence, by which the book must be renewed.</p>\n<p>Well, that&#8217;s how it worked until weekend I came back with <cite>Cannonball Simp</cite>. I <em>loved</em> it. I didn&#8217;t want to take it back because I hadn&#8217;t learned it yet. Sure I could &#8216;read&#8217; along with Dad &#8211; I knew all the words by then &#8211; but the pictures were another thing entirely. They were <em>beautiful</em>. They still are.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s when I learned of the magic of &#8216;renewal&#8217;. Instead of handing the book back, I showed it to the librarian and said &#8220;I&#8217;d like to renew this, please,&#8221; and instead of giving me my library card back, they just stamped the book and slip with a new date. Wow! It was like I <em>owned</em> the book.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know how many times I renewed that book. I&#8217;m afraid I don&#8217;t remember the words any more. But I still remember the pleasure that it gave me.</p>\n<h4>Galadriel the Fair</h4>\n<p>On the last day of junior school our form teacher, Miss Rees, wrote a long list of books on the board and asked us to copy the list into the back of our exercise books. She said that these were books we should try and read. I don&#8217;t have the exercise book any more and I remember very little of the list. I do remember that I&#8217;d already read some of them. And I remember <cite>The Hobbit</cite> and <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=intitle:%22The+Lord+of+the+Rings%22\">The Lord of the Rings</a>. Oh boy, do I remember <cite>The Hobbit</cite> and <cite>The Lord of the Rings</cite>.</p>\n<p>Terry Pratchett said that if you&#8217;re a 14 year old boy and you don&#8217;t think that The Lord of the Rings is the best book ever written then there may be something wrong with you, but if you&#8217;re 28 and you <em>still</em> think it&#8217;s the best book ever written then there&#8217;s <em>definitely</em> something wrong with you. I <em>was</em> that 14 year old boy. I stayed up all night reading it. I fell asleep reading it. I read the appendices. I worked out how to write my name in Elvish script. I even read <cite>The Silmarillion</cite> and thought I enjoyed it. I can still recite some of the poetry. In Elvish. I&#8217;ve forgotten the words of Cannonball Simp, but get me going with &#8220;A Elbereth Gilthoniel&#8230;&#8221; and I can just about reel off the rest of the poem. What&#8217;s wrong with me?</p>\n<p>By the time I was 28, LotR wasn&#8217;t the best book ever written. I&#8217;m no longer sure that there is such a thing as &#8220;The Best Book Ever Written&#8221;. Still, if you haven&#8217;t at least read <cite>The Hobbit</cite> you should take steps to rectify matters. Or wait for the Peter Jackson movie.</p>\n<h4>The Daughter of a Pirate King</h4>\n<p>Confession time: I haven&#8217;t read <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=intitle:%22Pippi+Longstocking%22\">Pippi Longstocking</a>. The &#8216;I&#8217; of <cite>A Child of the Library</cite> is a composite of Gill and me. <cite>Pippi Longstocking</cite> was her Nancy Blackett. The  <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=Bastable+inauthor:Nesbit\">Bastables</a> were her Pevensies.</p>\n<h4>Paddington the Bear</h4>\n<p>Once I&#8217;d learned that reading for myself was pure pleasure, I read anything and everything I could find in the library and I discovered Michael Bond&#8217;s <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;q=intitle:Paddington+inauthor:%22Michael+Bond%22\">Paddington Bear</a>. Paddington was a well meaning young bear from Peru who was found, wearing a duffel coat and a label reading &#8220;Please look after this bear&#8221;, at Paddington Station by the Brown Family. The Browns took him in immediately, named him Paddington after the station and&#8230; &#8216;hijinks ensue&#8217;.</p>\n<p>I would be quietly reading these books to myself when some episode or another (&#8220;Baked Elastic&#8221;; the Russian ballet dancer; the wobbly table&#8230;) would cause me to laugh out loud and my brother would demand to know what was funny and made me read whatever it was aloud to him. I have to confess, I resented this, but not enough to dent my enjoyment. The Paddington books are made of joy.</p>"

Mostly joyous, but frantic.</p>\n<p>I had talks accepted at both <a href=\"http://www.yapc2011.us/yn2011/\"><span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span></a> and <a href=\"http://oscon.com/\"><span class=\"caps\">OSCON</span></a>. Because <span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span> was in Asheville, and the <a href=\"http://www.swangathering.com/\">Swannanoa Gathering</a> Traditional Song Week fell the week after <span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span>, that meant I flew out to Asheville for an intense fortnight of Perl community engagement followed by a week spent singing myself hoarse and being blown away by <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/sheilakayadams\">Sheila Kay Adams&#8217;s</a> singing and her stories of mountain life and listening to future stars like <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/sheilakayadams\">Sam Gleaves</a> and inspiring activists like <a href=\"http://www.blairpathways.com/\">Saro Lynch Thomason</a>. I could write entire posts on every one of those, and that&#8217;s before I get on to the magic of watching the sun go down and the fireflies come up from the grass of the Warren Wilson College&#8217;s natural amphitheatre. Magical so it was.</p>\n<p>On the last night of the gathering, there was a student showcase. Of course, I sang <a href=\"http://www.bofh.org.uk/child-of-the-library\">Child of the Library</a>. Rather embarrassingly, I skipped a verse, but the response was great. Several people came up to me afterwards and told me their library stories and, I hope, went home with a determination to help protect their libraries.</p>\n<p>Then it was back to the UK for a fortnight before heading off again to <span class=\"caps\">OSCON</span> in Portland, OR. I was down to give two talks, one on <a href=\"http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011/public/schedule/detail/17872\">Higher Order Javascript</a> and a second on <a href=\"http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011/public/schedule/detail/18577\">Polymorphic Dispatch</a> which proved to be a bear to write. I&#8217;d planned to have everything done and dusted and the slides learned by the time I flew out, but spent a huge amount of time blocked on how I was going to present the ideas using a motivating problem that hit the sweet spot between too simple and too complicated. It wasn&#8217;t until I arrived in Portland and talked things through with my host, <a href=\"http://www.justatheory.com/\">David Wheeler</a>, that I got that worked out. The slides were written in a tearing rush and weren&#8217;t as good as I would like them to be. I still owe the talk attendees a full writeup, so I&#8217;ll take this opportunity to apologise for the lateness and promise that a writeup <em>will</em> arrive. The Javascript talk was based on one I&#8217;ve given before, but I&#8217;m starting to realise that it&#8217;s a full tutorial masquerading as a short talk. More on that later, I hope.</p>\n<p>What with flapping about the unwritten talk, and the 10 minute gap between them, I didn&#8217;t really worry overmuch about the Perl lightning talks. It&#8217;s been my practice to sing a lightly massaged version of <a href=\"http://LOUANDPETER.COM/\">Lou and Peter Berryman&#8217;s</a> very splendid song <cite>A Chat With Your Mother</cite> with tailored verses about different language communities and various Perl luminaries. I <em>had</em> decided to retire it, but at <span class=\"caps\">YAPC</span> I came up with a snide verse about myself and another about Larry Wall, so it felt renewed enough to be worth singing this year as well. I ended up singing Child of the Library again.</p>\n<p>The response was phenomenal. I&#8217;ve been singing it for long enough now that I know it <em>gets</em> people. Hell, when I was writing it, there were verses that were hard to sing because they got me and I was choking up as I tried to sing them. But the lightning talk got a standing ovation. Again people were telling me library stories and I found that the UK isn&#8217;t the only country with local governments stupid enough to consider closing libraries, it was happening in the US too. So, fired up by that response, I went to see Sarah Novotny and begged her for five minutes on the <span class=\"caps\">OSCON</span> stage before the closing keynote. Bless her, she let me have it.</p>\n<h3>Pics, or it didn&#8217;t happen!</h3>\n<p>I have proof too! The main stage at O&#8217;Reilly events has serious video equipment pointed at it. Because it&#8217;s important that people get to see serious talks about <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnX5v0uwNjc&amp;list=PL93FC98105B19725C&amp;index=39&amp;feature=plpp\">known bugs and exploits in wetware</a>. Because my performance wasn&#8217;t on the schedule, and I didn&#8217;t have a video release all signed and ready to go beforehand, it&#8217;s taken a while to get the video available. But last night, that changed, so here I am, in all my corpulent glory. Enjoy. And please, spread this video as far and as wide as you can. Libraries are important.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"345\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/MDi5JtS1H-g\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>"

This happens as I sing  it out to different audiences and find out which bits work, which bits are hard to sing and all the other little details that you only find out when there&#8217;s a living, breathing, listening and (hopefully) singing audience in front of you.</p>\n<p>It turns out that the same things happens with songs I&#8217;ve written.</p>\n<p>The biggest stumbling block of the original version is the last line of the first verse:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My wife met Pippi Langstumpf, I met Paddington the Bear</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Someone on the comment thread suggested:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Heidi, Pippi Longstocking and Paddington the Bear</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which is fine, except that means singing &#8216;PIPpi LONGstockING&#8217;, and I&#8217;m not happy with putting the emphasis on the <span class=\"caps\">WRONG</span> sylLABles if I can possibly help it. In the revised version, I think I&#8217;ve cracked it. The line is now:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The daughter of a pirate king and Paddington the bear</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which is <em>much</em> easier to sing and follows the rest of the verse by being a more oblique reference to the character. If you know who Pippi is, then it&#8217;s obvious who I&#8217;m singing about. If you don&#8217;t, then maybe I&#8217;ve piqued your curiosity.</p>\n<p>The first recording also had two slightly different tunes for the verses, this version has settled on just the one.</p>\n<p>And, for people who care about that sort of thing, this was recorded with a click track at 110bpm rather than speeding up over the course of the song, which should make life a little easier for anyone taking part in Rabid Gravy&#8217;s <a href=\"http://blog.rabidgravy.com/making-music-to-save-our-libraries\">project</a> to remix and rerecord different versions of the song.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re concerned about Library closures, a good place to start is <a href=\"http://www.voicesforthelibrary.org.uk/\">Voices for the Library</a>. If you&#8217;re on twitter, you might also start following <a href=\"http://twitter.com/ukpling\">@ukpling</a>. If you&#8217;re not concerned about library closures, why on earth did you read this far, and what kind of excuse for a human being are you?</p>"

Frankly, instrumentation scares me, I&#8217;m much happier singing unaccompanied but I realise I&#8217;m in a minority on this.</p>\n<p>When you sing it, try making the song your own by changing things to suit your own. Julie Chilton&#8217;s posted an alternate first verse in the comments, but the world is the mollusc of your choice.</p>\n<p>The &#8216;I&#8217; in the song, isn&#8217;t <em>quite</em> me and it isn&#8217;t quite Gill either. Most importantly, both of us grew up in houses where no book was out of bounds. Our fathers used to take us to our respective local libraries (Lewisham for Gill, Doncaster Central and then Bawtry for me) every week or so on a Saturday morning. As soon as I was old enough, I&#8217;d ride my bike from our home in Scrooby to Bawtry with a carrier full of books hanging off the handlebars. Bawtry is currently in the crosshairs of Doncaster&#8217;s idiot mayor &#8211; the bloke who suggested getting kindles for everyone instead &#8211; along with 13 other libraries in the district.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a revised version of the recording with additional notes at: http://www.bofh.org.uk/2011/04/04/a-child-of-the-library-revised, or just press play:</p>\n<p><object height=\"81\" width=\"100%\"> <param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F13031396\"></param> <param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param> <embed allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"81\" src=\"http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F13031396\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed> </object>  <span><a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/pdcawley/child-of-the-library-revised\">Child Of The Library (Revised)</a> by <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/pdcawley\">pdcawley</a></span></p>\n<h5>August 9th 2011</h5>\n<p>I&#8217;ve updated the lyrics here to reflect what I sing now.

Our proposal for a new <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/Submission/2012/SUBM-pointer-events-20120907/\">Pointer Events</a> Web standard is based on <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/09/20/touch-input-for-ie10-and-metro-style-apps.aspx\">the APIs available today</a> in IE10 on Windows 8. </p>\r\n<p>The Web is more exciting and interactive for users when sites enable experiences for multi-touch. It is even better when the same site continues to work if you switch to using a mouse or pen. We believe the Web should not be fragmented into sites designed for only one type of input. We designed Pointer Events to make it easier for developers to avoid this fragmentation by abstracting the differences of input devices while still allowing for device-specific enhancements when desired.</p>\r\n<p>Our goal with this submission is to work with other browser vendors and the wider Web community to move to adopt a new approach to multi-touch input. In the future, we hope that Web developers will only need to write to one pointer input model no matter if their users are using mouse, pen, touch, or whatever comes next.  The W3C <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/Submission/2012/03/Comment/\">noted,</a> “This Submission comes at a time of significant developer concern about creating content that works well on multiple input modalities, and in light of some disadvantages to the touch event model currently under standardization.”</p>\r\n<p>Other approaches to supporting multi-touch input require Web developers to write their code once for mouse input and again for touch, dealing with the sometimes complex interactions between the two models (for example, when touch events are mapped to mouse events for compatibility). Throughout the development of IE10, and thanks to your feedback, we designed the Pointer Events model to be more compatible with the existing Web and avoid these complexities. </p>\r\n<p>We encourage you to review the proposal and share your thoughts. The specification is a starting point and calls out several open issues for discussion and we look forward to making improvements based on your feedback.</p>\r\n<p>—Adrian Bateman and Jacob Rossi, Program Managers, Internet Explorer</p>\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div><img src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=10352780\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">"

bca8274d-3e40-c09d-373f-fcfb1510468a.description	"<p>In <a href=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2012/07/the-lost-secret-of-mug-driven-evolution.html\">The Lost Secret of Mug-Driven Evolution</a>, I asked \"Is it reasonable to write new code in Perl right now?\"</p>\n\n<p>I also said \"Build credible new things. Brag about them. Repeat.\"</p>\n\n<p>It's time to do that!</p>\n\n<h2>Trendshare.org</h2>\n\n<p>While <a href=\"http://onyxneon.com/\">Onyx Neon</a> still occupies a lot of\nmy attention, I've been working with a local company called <a\nhref=\"http://bigbluemarblellc.com/\">Big Blue Marble</a> to develop small\nweb-based businesses. This has taken me through a crash course in things like\nsearch engine optimization and statistics that I hadn't figured I'd ever need\nto know.</p>\n\n<p>(Half the fun of small business is realizing that there's something you\nshould have started doing months ago, that no one available has any experience\nwith it, and that one of you has a week to get to a basic level of competence\nwith it before you move on to the next crisis. The other half is realizing that\nthe next time you tackle a problem like this, you'll be that much better at\nit.)</p>\n\n<p>I've alluded to my work with financial analysis and basic financial literacy\na few times now. That's part of my work at Big Blue Marble on a site called <a\nhref=\"http://trendshare.org/\">Trendshare</a>. The big idea was to build\nsomething that our fathers would use to help them take back control of their\ninvestment portfolios. (They're smart men, but they've been for too long at the\nmercy of financial managers who don't have their best interests in mind, and\ntheir retirement accounts have suffered.)</p>\n\n<p>I know most of my readers aren't newly retired men who've taken\ndistributions and want to figure out where to put their money (short answer:\nfind one or two good low-cost index funds, and then take maybe 10% and pick a\ncouple of great stocks), and I know most of my readers are perfectly capable of\nbuilding spreadsheets and pulling financial data from various APIs to measure\nimportant ratios like debt-to-equity and forward and historical PE, but we\nbuilt a system that follows the Benjamin Graham value investing model, and\nwe're pretty proud of it so far.</p>\n\n<p>It's definitely closer to the <a\nhref=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2011/10/in-search-of-minimum-viable-utility.html\">minimum\nviable product</a>, but what active software project isn't? Besides that, who\nknows if the analysis engine will prove more popular than the plain-English\nguide to investing that's on the site as well. Maybe people would rather read\nabout how to invest than use tools to help them&mdash;and that's why we're\nannouncing it now rather than later.</p>\n\n<p>Almost all of the code in the project is Perl 5. I've started releasing some\nof the components to the CPAN. I'll continue to do so. I'd love it if you could\ndo us a favor and tell friends and family who might have an interest in such a\nthing that it exists, because we'd love to get more traffic, and especially\nhyperlinks from lots of places. Basic user accounts are free, and we take great\ncare to keep personal information private.</p>\n\n<h2>ModernPerl.net</h2>\n\n<p>Remember when mithaldu set up <a href=\"http://perl-tutorial.org/\">Perl\nTutorials</a>, after he noticed that too many of the top-ranking Perl pages in\nsearch engines were old, out of date, and even incorrect?</p>\n\n<p>Onyx Neon recently received the domain <a\nhref=\"http://modernperl.net/\">ModernPerl.net</a> as a generous gift from Ravi\nKotecha. I decided that the world needed yet another Perl hub and have (slowly)\nstarted to add resources to help point searchers to the relevant places.</p>\n\n<p>The entire site is one big SEO exercise, based on keyword research as to\nwhat people are looking for and what they're not finding well enough. (How\ncynical does that sound?) I do think it'll be a good resource because Onyx Neon\nhas the flexibility to update it to match what people search for.</p>\n\n<p>The code behind the site is a very silly, very simple static site generator\nwith lots of conventions, but it seems to work very well for basic sites. I\nwill eventually clean that up and release it too.</p>\n\n<h2>Book Info</h2>\n\n<p>I'm working on an outline for an updated Perl Testing book. My plan is still\nto create a Kickstarter project to build up interest for it (and to give me\ntime to focus on it full time as well as to finish releasing the book\npublishing tools to the CPAN.)</p>\n\n<p>There will be a 2012-2013 edition of <a\nhref=\"http://modernperlbooks.com/books/modern_perl\">Modern Perl</a> in the next\ncouple of months to replace the coverage of Perl 5.10 with the coverage of Perl\n5.16.</p>\n\n<p>I continue to intend to finish the Little Plack Book but recommend without reservation <a href=\"http://handbook.plackperl.org/\">the Plack Handbook</a>.</p>"
